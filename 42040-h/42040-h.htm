<h1 title="">THE CRUISE OF THE O MOO</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />A MYSTERIOUS TAPPING</h2>
<p>Lucile Tucker stirred in her berth, opened her
eyes drowsily, then half-framed a thought into
a whispered: &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant she sat bolt upright. She
had heard it again, this time not in a dream.
It was a faint rat-tat-tat, with a hollow sound
to it as if beaten on the head of a barrel.</p>
<p>She strained her ears to catch the slightest
sound but now caught only the constant lash-lash
of the flag-rope as it beat the mast of the
yacht, the O Moo, a sure sign of a rising storm.</p>
<p>She strained her eyes to peer into the darkness
to the right of her; she wanted to see her
two companions who should be sleeping there
to make sure they were still with her. She
could not see; the shutters were tightly closed
and there was no moon. The place was dark;
black as soot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>She stilled her breathing to listen again, but
caught only the lash-lash of that flag-rope,
accompanied now and then by the drumlike
boom of canvas. The storm was rising. Soon
it would be lashing the waves into white foam
to send them crashing high above the breakwaters.
She shivered. A storm aboard ship
had always frightened her.</p>
<p>Yet now as she thought of the term, &ldquo;aboard
ship,&rdquo; she shrugged her slim shoulders. Her
lips parted in a smile as she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cruise of the O Moo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly her thoughts were broken in upon
by the repetition of that mysterious sound of a
rat-tat-tat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a yellow-hammer drumming on a
hollow tree,&rdquo; was her unspoken comment, &ldquo;only
birds don&rsquo;t work at night. It&rsquo;s like&mdash;like
someone driving&mdash;yes, driving tacks. Only
who could it be? And anyway, why would they
drive tacks into our yacht at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>The thought was so absurd that she dismissed
it at once. Dismissing the whole problem
for the moment, she began thinking through
the events which had led up to that moment.</p>
<p>She, with Marian Norton, her cousin&mdash;as you
will remember if you chance to have read the
account of their previous adventure as recorded
in the book called &ldquo;The Blue Envelope&rdquo;&mdash;had
spent the previous year on the shores of
Behring Straits in Alaska and Siberia. There
they had been carried through a rather amazing
series of thrilling adventures which had not
been without their financial advantages, especially
to Marian.</p>
<p>Lucile&rsquo;s father had been, when she had left
her home at Anacortes, Washington, a well-to-do
salmon fisherman. She had felt no fear
of lack of money for further schooling. The
two girls had therefore planned to study during
this present year, Lucile at a great university
situated near the shore of Lake Michigan
and Marion in a renowned school of art in the
same city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>But fortune plays rude tricks at times.
They had returned to find that Lucile&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s
fortune had been dissipated by an unfortunate
investment in fish-traps for catching a run of
sock-eyed salmon, a salmon run which failed,
and that Marian&rsquo;s father had grub-staked a
&ldquo;sure-winner&rdquo; gold mine which had panned out
not enough gold to pay for the miner&rsquo;s &ldquo;mucklucks&rdquo;
(skin-boots).</p>
<p>So Marian had given up the major portion
of the money paid to her by the Ethnological
Society for her sketches and Lucile had abandoned
all hope of receiving money from her
father for a university education. They had
not, however, given up their plans for further
schooling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to live carefully and not spend an
extra cent,&rdquo; had been Marian&rsquo;s way of summing
up the situation. &ldquo;And we can make it all
right. Why, just look at the price for rooms
at the university.&rdquo; She referred to a catalogue
in her hand. &ldquo;Twenty-three dollars a term.
That is less than two dollars a week. We
could pay that. Rooms outside the university
certainly can&rsquo;t be any more&mdash;probably not as
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile smiled now as she recalled this bit
of crude reasoning.</p>
<p>They had hurried on to the university with
their little checking accounts. They had had&mdash;</p>
<p>But here again Lucile started and sprang
half out of her berth. Came again that mysterious
rat-tat-tat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Marian!
Florence! Wake up. Someone is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words, uttered in a whisper, died
on her lips. The other girls slept on. What
was the use of waking them? Couldn&rsquo;t be anything
serious. And if it were, what could they
do at this mad hour of night? Suppose they
routed out old Timmie, keeper of the dry dock,
what could he do? It was black as jet out
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>So she reasoned, and, having settled back
between her blankets, began again the recalling
of events.</p>
<p>They had arrived in the city by the lake to
be completely disillusioned. All university rooms
had been reserved for months ahead. So too
had all outside rooms which might be had for
a reasonable price. To pay the price demanded
for such rooms as were available had been impossible.
They faced the danger of being
obliged to return to their homes, and this, to
such girls as they were, was a calamity unthinkable.</p>
<p>Just at this critical moment, the O Moo had
shown her masts above the horizon. She was a
trim little pleasure yacht, thoroughly equipped
for living on board. She belonged to a wealthy
doctor named Holmes, a life-time friend of Lucile&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in dry dock down about two miles
from the university,&rdquo; he had told the girls.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to live in her for the winter.
Canvas over her now but you can prop that up
here and there, I guess. Make a snug place to
camp, I&rsquo;d say. Cabin&rsquo;s about ten by thirty and
there&rsquo;s everything you&rsquo;d need, from an eggbeater
to an electric range. There&rsquo;s electric
lights and everything; valve-in-the-head motor
supplies &rsquo;em. Go on; live there if you want to;
keep house and everything. Pretty stiff walk to
the U. But there&rsquo;s the lagoon in winter, with
good skating a mile and a half of the way.
What say&mdash;want to try it? Old Timmie, the
keeper of the dry dock, will see that nobody
bothers you. There&rsquo;s some Chinamen living in
a barge out there, some fishermen in a smack
and a young chap in a gasoline schooner. Guess
they are all peaceable folks, though. Might get
another girl or two to go in with you. Plenty
of room. We live on board her two months
every summer, two families of us, six in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the girls had been captivated at once by
this novel plan, once they had climbed aboard
the yacht, they had been thrilled and delighted
at the sight which met their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s a regular little floating palace!&rdquo;
Lucile had stammered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut!&rdquo; Mr. Holmes had remonstrated,
&ldquo;not quite a palace, though comfortable enough,
and not floating at all, at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a cruise&mdash;the winter cruise of the
O Moo,&rdquo; Lucile had exclaimed in delight.</p>
<p>Had she but known how real these words
would be to her some time hence&mdash;&ldquo;The winter
cruise of the O Moo&rdquo;&mdash;she might have shuddered
with fear and been sorely tempted not to
accept her new home.</p>
<p>The power of divination was not one of her
talents, so, with Marian at her side, she had proceeded
to lift the heavy canvas which enshrouded
the yacht&rsquo;s deck, and, having crept ...</p>
<p>A truly wonderful cabin it was, all done in
dark oak, with broad panels of green canvas
along the walls, equipped with heavy oak tables
and heavily over-stuffed chairs and lounges. It
presented the appearance of a splendidly furnished
but rather eccentric living room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Here at one end the touch of a lever sent an
electric range springing up from the floor. A
second lever lowered a partition between this
suddenly improvised kitchenette and the living
room. Two cupboards to the right of this kitchen
displayed dishes and cooking utensils. The
opposite wall furnished a table which folded up
when not in use. Behind this was a fully
equipped kitchen cabinet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convenient when in use, out of the way
when not needed,&rdquo; had been the doctor&rsquo;s only
comment.</p>
<p>This kitchen was forward. Aft were to be
found four double berths. Modeled after the
upper berths of a Pullman sleeper, these gave
the maximum of comfort and when folded up
occupied no space at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; had been the most the girls
could say. &ldquo;And, oh! Doctor Holmes, we&rsquo;ll pay
you rent for it. You surely must allow us to do
that,&rdquo; Marian had exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; the good doctor had exclaimed.
&ldquo;Worked my way through school myself. Know
what it means. All I ask is that you pass the
good work on to some other fellow who needs
a boost when you are through with school and
making money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So here they were, and had been for two
months, all comfortably established in the cabin
of the O Moo.</p>
<p>Dr. Holmes had suggested that they might be
able to accommodate another girl. They had
become acquainted with Florence Huyler, a
freshman in the physical culture department,
and had decided at once that she was just the
girl to join them.</p>
<p>Florence had not waited for a second invitation
and here she was sleeping in the berth to
Lucile&rsquo;s right. Just why she should have seemed
most fitting as a companion for such an adventure
I can best tell you as events progress.</p>
<p>The long hike back and forth to the university
and the art school had been a bit tiring at first,
but in time they had come to enjoy it. Then
winter had come and with it ice on the lagoon.
Only yesterday they had had their first wonderful
race over its shining surface. Her recollections
came slower and slower and she was about
to drift off into a dream when there came again
that strange rat-tat-tat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Once more she sat bolt upright to peer into
the darkness; once more she asked herself the
questions: &ldquo;What can it be? Should I waken
Marian and Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not waken them. To do so would
seem, she thought, a trifle silly. The yacht
stood upon a car with iron wheels which rested
on a track raised five feet above the ground by
a stout trestle work. The sides of the yacht
towered above this trestle. Altogether the deck
of the yacht was fully twenty feet from the
ground. They ascended and descended by
means of a rope ladder. This ladder, at the
present moment, lay on the deck. No one could
enter their cabin unless he were possessed of a
ladder and any person attempting this would at
once be detected and might be arrested for it,
so why be afraid?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>But, after all, that sound was puzzling. She
wanted to know what it meant. For some time
she contemplated slipping on her dressing-gown
to creep out on deck and peer over the side. But
the wind was chill and still rising. The flag-rope
was whipping the mast with ever-increasing
fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold out there,&rdquo; she thought with a shiver.
&ldquo;Glad the O Moo is in dry dock and not on the
water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden thought brought a new fear. Of a
whole line of schooners and yachts on that track
in the dry dock, the O Moo was the one closest
to the water. What if she should slip back into
the water and be driven out into the lake!
Lucile shivered again. Then she smiled. How
absurd. Did not a heavy cable hold her in
place? Were not the wheels of the car, on
which she rested, blocked? How then could she
glide back into the lake?</p>
<p>Fortunately, it did not occur to her that this
very tap-tap-tapping might be the knocking of
a hammer which was driving those blocks from
their positions before the wheels of the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Since this thought did not come to her and,
since the tapping did not come again, she at last
snuggled down among the blankets and fell
asleep.</p>
<p>Hardly had she wakened in the morning before
she recalled this strange incident of the
night. Hurriedly slipping into a middy suit and
slippers, she raced up the short gangway and
across deck, tossing the rope ladder over the
side. The next moment she might have been
seen walking slowly about the hull of the yacht.
She was searching for traces of the strange
tapping.</p>
<p>Having passed along the south side, she
climbed through the trestle and made her way
along the north side. She was about to conclude
that the night&rsquo;s experience had been purely an
imaginary one when a white spot near the prow
attracted her attention.</p>
<p>She caught her breath as her hand reached
for it. It was a square bit of paper held in
place by four tacks which had apparently been
driven into the hull with great deliberation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That explains the tapping,&rdquo; she whispered
to herself. &ldquo;Sure had their courage right along
with them. Thought we&rsquo;d be afraid to interfere,
being just girls, I suppose. Wonder what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached up and pulled the paper free from
the tacks. As soon as she had it in her hand she
realized that written on it was a message. She
read it&mdash;read it twice&mdash;then stood there
staring.</p>
<p>The paper was of a peculiar rice-straw variety.
The words were written in a strangely
artistic fashion. Fine as the tracing of a
woman&rsquo;s pen, each letter stood out distinct, done
in curves of wonderful perfection, the work of
a master penman.</p>
<p>But she did not pause to admire the handwriting;
it was the meaning of the words that
startled her as she read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not stay here. You shall not stay.
I have said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was signed only with a crosslike figure, a
bizarre sketch that might well have represented
the claw of a bird&mdash;or a dragon, Lucile added
with a little intake of breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must show the girls,&rdquo; she exclaimed, and
nimble as a squirrel, was away over the trestle
and up the rope ladder.</p>
<p>When the other girls had heard Lucile&rsquo;s story
and had read the note they were more astonished
than alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence, gripping an iron
rod above her and lifting her full hundred and
sixty pounds easily with one hand. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
telling us whether we can stay here or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say they better not let you get near
them,&rdquo; smiled Lucile.</p>
<p>Florence laughed and, releasing her grip on
the rod, sat down to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem possible it could be anyone
living in the other boats,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen that young man they call Mark Pence, the
fellow who lives in the gasoline schooner, just
once. He seems to be decent enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the old fishermen,&rdquo; put in Marian, &ldquo;I
hired two of them to pose for some sketches last
week. Nice old fellows, they are; a little rough
but entirely harmless. Besides, what difference
could it make to them whether we live here or
not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Chinamen who run a little
laundry in that old scow,&rdquo; said Lucile thoughtfully,
&ldquo;but they are the mildest-mannered of
them all, with their black pajama suits and pigtails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all of them, except Old Timmie
and his wife,&rdquo; said Florence, rising and pressing
the lever which brought the electric range into
position. &ldquo;And as for Timmie, I&rsquo;d as soon suspect
my own father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell him about it,&rdquo; said Lucile. &ldquo;He
might help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did tell Timmie, but he could throw no
light on the subject. He appeared puzzled and
a little disturbed, but his final counsel was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone playing a practical joke on you.
Pay no attention to it. Pay no attention at all.&rdquo;
The girls accepted his advice. Indeed, there
was nothing they could do about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; was Lucile&rsquo;s concluding word,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. Looks as if someone in this
vicinity were doing something they should not
do and were afraid we&rsquo;d catch them at it. I for
one shall keep an eye out for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two girls agreed with her, and
while they did not alter their daily program in
the least, they did keep a sharp lookout for suspicious
characters who might be lurking about
the dry dock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />THE BLUE FACE IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Lucile need not have kept an eye out for
trouble. Trouble was destined to find her and
needed no watching. As she expressed it afterward:
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter much where
you are nor what you are doing, if you are destined
for adventures you&rsquo;ll have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the thing which happened to her on the
following evening, though doubly mysterious
and haunting in its character, appeared to have
no connection whatever to the incident of the
note.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>The storm which had been rising all night had
lulled with the morning sun, but by mid-afternoon
was raging again with redoubled fury.
Sending the spray dashing high above the breakwaters,
it now and then cast a huge cake of ice
clear of the water&rsquo;s tallest crest and brought it
down upon the breakwater&rsquo;s rim with the sound
of an exploding cannon. Carrying blinding
sheets of snow before it, the wind rose steadily
in force and volume until the most hardy pedestrian
made headway against it with the
greatest difficulty.</p>
<p>When Lucile left the university grounds to
face east and to begin forcing her way against
the wind to the yacht, night had fallen. &ldquo;Dark
as it should be at seven&mdash;woo! what a gale!&rdquo;
she shivered, as buttoning her mackinaw tightly
about her throat, she bent forward to meet the
storm.</p>
<p>For a half hour, her body beaten and torn by
the wind, her face cut by driving sleet, she
fought her way onward into the night. She had
reached the shore of the lake and was making
her way south, or at least thought she was. So
dense was the darkness that it was with the
utmost difficulty that she kept her directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish&mdash;wish I had tried getting a place to
stay nearer the university,&rdquo; she half sobbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>As if in answer to these words, the storm appeared
to redouble its fury. Seizing her with its
whirling grip, it carried her in a semicircle, to
land her at last against a stone wall. So great
was the force of her impact that for the
moment she lay there at the foot of the wall,
only partly conscious of what was going on
about her.</p>
<p>When at last she was able to rise, she knew
that she had completely lost her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well follow the wall,&rdquo; she thought
desperately. &ldquo;Little more sheltered here. Bring
me to some place after a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fury of wind and snow continued. At
times she fancied she felt the spray from waves
dampen her cheeks. She heard distinctly the
break of these waves&mdash;&ldquo;Against the wall,&rdquo; she
told herself, shuddering as the thought came to
her that she might suddenly reach the end of this
wall and be blown into the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway I can&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; she muttered.
&ldquo;Too cold. Face is freezing, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>She paused to remove a glove and touch her
cheek. The next instant she was rubbing it
vigorously. &ldquo;Frozen all right. Have to get in
somewhere soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment her heart leaped wildly.
For a moment the drive of snow had slackened.
In that moment, a great, black bulk loomed up
at her right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some building,&rdquo; she thrilled, and at once
doubled her efforts to escape from the storm and
reach this promised shelter.</p>
<p>As, still hugging the wall, she came closer to
the looming structure, she saw that it showed
not a single gleaming light. The next moment
her lips parted in an exclamation of dismay:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Spanish Mission! No one there&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
been for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once she had forced her mind to sober
thought, she realized that she had no reason to
hope for anything better. There were but four
structures on that mile of park-front on the lake
all deserted at this time of year: a broad, low
pavilion; a huge, flat bath-house; a towering
castle, relic of a great fair once held on these
grounds, and this Spanish Mission, which never
had been a real mission, but merely a reproduction
of one dating back into other centuries, a
huge wooden hull of a thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Resembling a block-house, with its narrow
windows and low doors, it had always stirred
Lucile&rsquo;s curiosity. Now she was about to seek
shelter in it, or at least in the lee of it. It was
deserted, empty, fast falling into decay, a mysterious,
haunty place. Yet, so buffeted by the
storm was she, so frightened by the onrush of
the elements, that she felt quite equal to creeping
through some opening into its vast emptiness
should an opening appear.</p>
<p>And an opening did offer her opportunity to
test her nerve. It was a window, the glass shattered
by the storm. Her heart beating wildly, she
squeezed through into the inky blackness. On
tiptoe, she made her way down the wall to the
right. She was obliged to feel for every step.
There was not a ray of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some big hall,&rdquo; she decided. After she had
moved along for a space of forty feet or more
she whispered: &ldquo;The chapel!&rdquo; Her heart
skipped a beat. &ldquo;Imagine being in a deserted
chapel on such a night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Suddenly overcome with the thought that she
might stumble into an altar or a crucifix, she
halted and stood there trembling. She had always
felt a great awe for such things.</p>
<p>She stood there until her legs ached with the
strain of holding to one position. Then she
pushed on slowly. Suddenly she brushed against
something. Recoiling in fright, she stood there
motionless.</p>
<p>At last she had the courage to bend over and
put out a hand. To her intense relief, she found
that she had come upon a bench standing against
the wall. Having tested its strength, she sat
down. Leaning back, she rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;The storm
will soon be over. Then I&rsquo;ll get out of here and
go to the yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drive of the wind, the chill of the storm
had made her drowsy. The night before her
sleep had been disturbed. As she sat there her
head drooped more and more. It began nodding,
then suddenly came up with a jerk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Again she was awake! She would not fall
asleep, she told herself. Would not. Would
not!</p>
<p>Yet, in three minutes she was nodding again.
This time her chin sank lower and lower, until
at last it rested on her breast, which moved
slowly up and down in the rhythmic breathing
of one who sleeps.</p>
<p>How long she slept would be hard to tell. So
natural was her awaking that she did not realize
that she had been asleep at all.</p>
<p>Yet she sensed that something about the place
was different. A vague uneasiness stole over
her.</p>
<p>Once she had opened her eyes, she knew what
it was. There was light&mdash;a strange light,
somewhere in the room; a dim, almost imperceptible
illumination pervaded all.</p>
<p>As she turned her head, without moving in
her seat, she with difficulty suppressed a scream.</p>
<p>At the far end of the room was an apparition,
or so at least it seemed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A blue face! A face of blue fire. It can&rsquo;t
be.&rdquo; She rubbed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it is.&rdquo; Her mind did all the talking.
Her lips were numb. It is doubtful if she could
have spoken had she dared to. But this was no
time to speak.</p>
<p>She did not believe in ghosts, yet there was a
face, an illumined face; an ugly face, more
fiendish than any she had ever seen. Appearing
alive, it rose from the center of a decaying table
standing before an altar. Beside the altar, revealed
by the pale, bluish light which the face
appeared to shed about it, were two tarnished
candlesticks and back of it, against the wall,
hung a crucifix.</p>
<p>Completely paralyzed by the sight of this blue
face in the night and by its awesome surroundings,
she sat there quite motionless.</p>
<p>The light of the blue face appeared to wax
and wane, to come and go like the faint smiles
that often pass over a child&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Lucile was suddenly seized with the notion
that the face was looking at her. At the same
time there came the question: &ldquo;Is there light
enough to reveal my face?&rdquo; She glanced down
to the floor, then breathed a sigh of relief; she
could not see her own feet. Silently drawing
her scarf over her face, covering all but her
eyes and hiding her hands beneath her coat, she
sat there hardly daring to breathe.</p>
<p>She did not have long to wait for, out of the
darkness into the pale blue light, there stole
three figures. Whether these were men or
women, monks, nuns or devils, she could not tell,
so closely were they enshrouded in robes or
coats of black cloth.</p>
<p>They knelt before the blue face and remained
there motionless.</p>
<p>To quiet her nerves, Lucile began to count.
She had reached one hundred, when, for fear
she would lose all control of herself and scream
or run, she closed her eyes. She had counted
to one thousand before she dared open them
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>When she did so she found another surprise
awaiting her. The kneeling figures were gone.
Gone, too, was the face; or at least, it was no
longer illumined. The place was dark as a dungeon.
Strangely enough, too, the wail of the
storm had subsided to a whisper. Only the
distant boom of breakers told her that a terrific
blizzard had passed over the lake.</p>
<p>Rising without a sound, she tiptoed her way
along the wall. Reaching the window, she
leaped out upon the ground and was away like
a flash. With knees that trembled so they
would scarcely support her, she ran for a full
half mile before she dared slow down and look
back. The snowstorm was over, the moon half
out. She could see for some distance behind her,
but all she saw was a glistening stretch of snowy
landscape. Then she made her way thoughtfully
to the dry dock.</p>
<p>Once on board the O Moo she told the other
girls nothing of her adventures; merely said she
had been delayed by the storm. But that evening
as she attempted to study, she would now and
then give a sudden start. Once she sprang up
so violently that she upset her chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world is the matter?&rdquo; Marian
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, just nerves,&rdquo; she said, forcing a
smile, but she did not attempt to study after
that. She went and curled up in a huge, upholstered
rocker. Even here she did not fall asleep,
but sat staring wide-eyed before her until it was
bedtime.</p>
<p>They had all been in their berths for fifteen
minutes. Florence had dozed off when she was
suddenly wakened by a hand on her arm. It
was Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;please!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
sleep alone to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence put out a strong hand and drew her
up into the berth, then pulled the covers down
over them both and clasped her gently in her
arms.</p>
<p>Lucile did not move for some time. She had
apparently fallen asleep when she suddenly
started violently and whispered hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! It can&rsquo;t be; I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe
in ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>At the same time a great shudder shot
through her frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; whispered Florence, holding
her tight.</p>
<p>Then, in halting, whispered sentences, Lucile
told of the night&rsquo;s adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; whispered Florence. &ldquo;Reminds
me of something an aged sailor told me
once, something that happened on the Asiatic
side of the Pacific. Too long to tell now. Tell
you sometime though. Doesn&rsquo;t seem as if there
could be any connection. Surely couldn&rsquo;t be.
But you never can tell. Better turn over and go
to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relieved of half her fear by the telling of the
story, Lucile fell asleep and slept soundly until
morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />LUCILE&rsquo;S QUICK ACTION GAS</h2>
<p>You must not imagine (and you might well
be forgiven for doing so, if you have read the
preceding chapters) that the experiences of the
three girls whose lives are pictured here were
a series of closely crowded thrilling adventures.
It was not the case that no sooner was the curtain
run down on one mysterious happening than
the stage was set for another. Few lives are like
that. Adventures do come to us all at times and
we face them for the most part bravely. Some
amuse and entertain, others startle and appall,
but each teaches in its own way some new lesson
of life.</p>
<p>Adventures taken from the lives of others
bring to us the greatest ratio of entertainment,
but it is our own exciting and mysterious adventures
that we speak of most often when we are
clustered on the deck of some vessel or gathered
about a camp fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>While not many pages of this book may be
devoted to the everyday school life of these girls,
they had it just the same. Florence and Lucile
strolled the campus as other girls strolled. They
cut classes at times. They passed difficult examinations
with some credit. They reveled in the
grandeur of the architecture of the buildings of
the university. They thrilled at the thought that
they were a part of the great throng that daily
swarmed from the lecture halls, and were somewhat
downcast when they came fully to realize
their own insignificance when cast into such a
tossing sea of humanity.</p>
<p>Marian, the artist, also had her everyday
rounds to make. She caught the 8:15 car downtown
five days in the week to labor industriously
with charcoal and brush. She saw her Alaskan
sketches, which had been praised so often and
so highly, picked to pieces by the ruthless criticism
of a competent teacher, but she rallied from
her first disappointment to resolve for better
work in the future. She began to plan how this
might be accomplished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Florence, Marian and Lucile were plain, ordinary,
normal girls, yet in one respect they were
different from others; at least Lucile and Marian
were from the first, and Florence, being the
strongest, most physically capable of them all,
soon caught their spirit. They had about them
a certain fearless outlook on life which is nearly
always found in those who have spent many
months in the far North&mdash;an attitude which
seems to say, &ldquo;Adventure and Trouble, I have
met you before. I welcome you and will profit
by and conquer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three rather ordinary incidents in their
life on board the O Moo prove that the life
they lived there was, on the whole, a very simple,
normal life, yet they also illustrate the indisputable
fact that the simplest matters in the world,
the casting of a tin can off a boat for instance,
may be connected with some interesting and
thrilling adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>As to that particular tin can, Marian bought it
at a grocery store along with twenty-three other
cans, filled with some unknown contents and
sold at the ridiculously low price of eight cents
per can. The reason that the price was so low
and the contents unknown was that the labels
had, during the process of handling, been accidentally
torn off. The cans had been sent on to
the retailer and were sold in grab-bag lots of
two dozen each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the obliging grocer had explained,
&ldquo;there may be only corn or peas in them. Very
well, they are even then worth twelve cents a
can at the very least. But then again there may
be blackberries in thick syrup, worth thirty or
forty cents a can. Then what a bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, girls,&rdquo; Marian exclaimed when she
had finished telling of her bargain and they of
exclaiming over it, &ldquo;what shall we have for dinner
to-night? Loganberries in thick syrup or
sliced pineapple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pineapple by all means!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough for me,&rdquo; smiled Lucile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Here goes.&rdquo; Marian stabbed one
of the unknown quantities with the can-opener,
then applied her nose to the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corn!&rdquo; she exclaimed in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; consoled Florence, &ldquo;we can eat
corn once. Lucile doesn&rsquo;t care for it, but she
can have something else. Here&rsquo;s a bowl; pour it
out in that. Then open the loganberries. They&rsquo;ll
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the can-opener fell. Again came the
disgusted exclamation, &ldquo;Corn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile giggled and Florence danced a hornpipe
of joy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one on you, Marian, old dear,&rdquo;
she shouted. &ldquo;Oh, well, just give us plain
peaches. They&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one that has a real gurgly sound
when you shake it,&rdquo; said Lucile, holding a can to
her ear and shaking hard. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s strawberries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>When Marian opened that can and had peered
into it, she said never a word but, walking to
the cabin door, pitched it, contents and all, over
the rail and down to the crusted snow twenty
feet below. There it bounced about for a time,
spilled its contents upon the ground, then lay
quite still, a new tin can glistening in the moonlight.
But watch that can. It is connected with
some further adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corn! Corn! Corn!&rdquo; chanted Marian in a
shrill voice breaking with laughter. &ldquo;And what
a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look what I drew!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile,
pointing to a can she had just opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pineapple! Sliced pineapple!&rdquo; the others
cheered in unison. Then the three cans of corn
were speedily forgiven. But the empty can lay
blinking in the moonlight all the same.</p>
<p>The other affair, which occurred a few days
later, might have turned into a rather serious
matter had it not been for Lucile&rsquo;s alert mind.</p>
<p>Lucile had what she styled a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; for creating
things. &ldquo;If only,&rdquo; she exclaimed again
and again, &ldquo;I could create something different
from anything that has been created before I
know I should be supremely happy. If only I
could write a real story that would get into print,
or discover some new chemical combination that
would do things, that would be glorious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>From these words one is not long in concluding
that Lucile was specializing in English and
chemistry.</p>
<p>The yacht afforded her exceptional opportunities
to pursue her study of chemistry out of
regular school hours, for Dr. Holmes, who devoted
much time to delving into the mysteries of
organic chemistry, had installed in a triangular
space at the back of the cabin a perfectly
equipped laboratory. Here, during the days of
the summer tour, he spent much of his time.
This laboratory he turned over to Lucile, the
only provision being that she replace test-tubes,
retorts and other instruments broken during the
course of her experiments.</p>
<p>Here on many a stormy afternoon, and often
long into the night, she worked over a blue
flame, concocting all manner of fluids and gases
not required by the courses she was taking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could create&mdash;<i>create</i>!&rdquo; she whispered
to herself over and over. &ldquo;Memory work
I hate. Imitation I like only because it tells me
what has been done and helps me to discover
what has not been done. But to create&mdash;Oh&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
She would at such times grip at her
breast as if her heart were paining her at the
very excitement of the thought.</p>
<p>On one particular afternoon, she did create
something&mdash;in fact she created a great deal of
excitement.</p>
<p>She had taken down a formula which Dr.
Holmes had left in a notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks interesting,&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
She had worked herself up, that day, to a feverish
heat, to a point where she would dare
anything.</p>
<p>As she read a closely written notation beneath
the formula, her eyes widened. &ldquo;It is interesting,&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Tremendous! I&rsquo;ll make
it. Wouldn&rsquo;t dare try it on anyone, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better have a gas mask,&rdquo; she told herself
after a moment&rsquo;s thought. Digging about in a
deep drawer she at last took out a strange canvas
bag with a windpipe-like attachment. This
she hung upon a peg while she selected the particular
vials needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>After that she drew the gas mask over her
head and plunged into the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten grains,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;a fluid ounce;
three drams; three fluid ounces; heat this in a
beaker; add two drams&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she went on mumbling to herself in her
excitement, like some witch in a play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad! Too bad! Won&rsquo;t hold it,&rdquo; she
mumbled at last, after waiting for her concoction
to cool. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t go in one vial. Have to
use two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having filled one thin glass vial and closed it
with a glass-stopper, she was in the act of filling
the second when the half-filled vial slipped from
her hand and went crashing to the tile floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Help!&rdquo; she uttered a muffled scream,
and, before she realized what she was doing,
threw the door leading into the main cabin wide
open. Before her, regarding her in great astonishment,
were Marian and Florence. For a few
seconds they stood there, then of a sudden they
began to act in the most startling manner.
Jumping up and down, waving their arms,
laughing, screaming, they vaulted over tables,
knocked chairs end-over-end and sent books and
papers flying in every direction.</p>
<p>Having recovered her power of locomotion,
Lucile dashed for the outer door. This she flung
wide open. Then, watching her chance, she propelled
her two delirious, dancing companions out
into the open air.</p>
<p>There, for a moment, she was obliged to cling
to them lest they throw themselves over the rail,
to go crashing to the frozen earth below.</p>
<p>In another moment it was all over. The two
wild dancers collapsed, crumpling up in heaps on
the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I really truly am.&rdquo;
Lucile&rsquo;s mortification was quite complete, in spite
of the fact that she was fairly bursting with a
desire to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;made us do that?&rdquo; Florence
stammered weakly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gas, a new gas,&rdquo; answered Lucile. Then,
seeing the look of consternation on the girls&rsquo;
faces, she hastened to add, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly harmless;
doesn&rsquo;t attack the tissues; works on the
motor nerves like laughing-gas only it gets all
the muscles excited, not just those of the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; remarked Marian, &ldquo;you really
created something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I had,&rdquo; said Lucile regretfully,
&ldquo;but that chances to be a formula worked out
by Dr. Holmes. I merely mixed it up. The
bottle slipped from my hand and smashed on
the floor&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t aim to try it out on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the cabin had been thoroughly aired,
the three girls went back to their work. As
Lucile put the laboratory in order she noted the
vial containing the remainder of the strange
fluid. Having labeled it, &ldquo;Quick action gas,&rdquo;
she put it away on the shelf, little dreaming that
she would find an unusual use for it later.</p>
<p>It was two weeks after Lucile&rsquo;s mysterious
experience in the old Mission building. Things
had settled down to the humdrum life of hard
work and faithful study. On Saturday night
two girls from the university dormitories skated
down the lagoon and walked down the beach to
spend the evening at the &ldquo;ship,&rdquo; as they called it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>They were jolly Western girls. The five of
them spent a pleasant evening popping corn,
pulling candy and relating amusing incidents
from their own lives. At eleven the visitors
declared that they must go home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll go a piece with you,&rdquo; suggested
Florence, reaching for her skates.</p>
<p>At the end of the lagoon the three put on
their skates. Florence&rsquo;s were on first, for she
wore a boyish style which went on with a clamp.</p>
<p>Gliding out on the ice, she struck out in a
wide circle, then returned to the others. Just
as they came gliding out to meet her, she fancied
she caught a movement in the branches of some
shrubs at the left which grew down to the edge
of the ice. For a second her eyes rested there,
then she was obliged to turn about to join her
companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>It was a glorious night; the skating was wonderful.
Keen air caressed their cheeks as they
shot over the glistening surface to the tune of
ringing steel. Little wonder she forgot the
moving bushes in the joy of the moment.</p>
<p>Florence was a born athlete. Tipping the
scale at one hundred and sixty, she carried not
a superfluous ounce of fat. Four hours every
day she spent on the gym floor or in the swimming
pool. She was equipping herself for the
work of a physical culture teacher and took her
task seriously. She believed that most girls
could be as strong as boys if they willed to be,
and she proceeded to set a shining example.</p>
<p>It was on her return trip that she was reminded
of the moving bushes. Catching the distant
ring of skates, she saw a person dressed
in a long coat of some sort coming rapidly
toward her.</p>
<p>The channel where they would meet was narrow.
Some instinct told her to turn back, to
circle the island and to reach the nearest point
to the yacht that way. Whirling about, she set
herself going rapidly in the other direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that was a foolish thing to do,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;Probably someone saving a long
walk by putting on his skates, same as I&rsquo;m doing.
Might embarrass him to have me turn about that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was getting in some long, strong strokes
now. There were few who could gain on her
when she chose to exert herself.</p>
<p>She rounded the point of the island with a
swift curve, then went skimming down the other
side. Without further thought of the lone
skater, she was nearing her goal and had gone
into a long slide when, of a sudden the clip-clip
of skates again came to her ears. It was hardly
necessary for her to turn about to make sure
that the stranger in the long coat had also
rounded the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>For a second she glided on, uncertain what
course to take. It was nearing midnight. She
was alone on the lagoon, a long way from any
habitation. A stranger was following her; why,
she could not tell. To throw off her skates and
gain the bank before he came up was impossible.
She decided, without being greatly alarmed
about it, again to circle the island and, if necessary,
take a spin the whole length of the lagoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />TRAPPED IN THE OLD MUSEUM</h2>
<p>Florence had little fear for the outcome of
this rather amusing adventure. She had been
trailed over the ice by possible admirers before.
She did not care to allow this one to catch up
with her, that was all. She would skim along
down to the far end of the lagoon where, a mile
and a half away, the dome of the old museum
loomed, a black bulk in the dark. She would then
make the broad turn which this end of the
lagoon afforded. She would have a clear mile
and a half in which to put forth her best efforts.
Surely she could outdistance the stranger and,
with skates off, be away over the slope and down
the beach toward the O Moo before he had
reached this end of the lagoon once more.</p>
<p>Saving her strength on the down trip, keeping
an even distance from the mysterious skater, she
glided onward toward the old museum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Just as she neared the broad end, where she
was to make the turn, she glanced back. At that
very moment, the flash of a powerful automobile
lamp on the park drive a half mile away
fell full upon the stranger&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>A little cry escaped her lips. This was no
mere youthful enthusiast. His was the face of
one whom few would trust. At that very
moment his visage was twisted into an ugly
snarl which said plainer than words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young lady, I have you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;that
might be the face of a murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that same instant, there flashed through
her mind the note of warning tacked on the
schooner. Perhaps this was the man who had
placed it there.</p>
<p>In her consternation, she missed a stroke.
One skate struck a crack in the ice; the clamp
slipped; the skate went flying; disaster impended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Florence was not a person to be easily defeated.
One instant she had kicked the remaining
skate from her foot and the next she was
racing away over the glistening ice. She stumbled
and all but fell. But, gaining courage from
the near-by sloping bank, she plunged on.</p>
<p>Now she was ten yards away, now five. The
metal cut-cut of skates behind her grew louder.
Redoubling her efforts, she at last flung herself
upon the snowy slope, to climb on hands and
knees to the crest, then to race across a level
space and gain the sheltering shadows of the
museum.</p>
<p>It had been a hard struggle. For a few seconds
she leaned panting against the wall. One
skate was still in her hand. Without thinking
why, she tucked this skate into the belt of her
coat.</p>
<p>Her mind was in a whirl. What should she
do? She was not safe here. For the man to
remove his skates and scale the bank required
but a moment. They were alone in the frozen
park, a mile from any protection she could be
sure of. She was not a good runner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>She chanced to glance up, and her lips parted
in a suppressed exclamation. There was a window
open above her. True, it was some fifteen
feet up, but there was an iron grating on the
window beneath it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only the grating is not rusted out,&rdquo; she
murmured hopefully, and the next instant she
had reached the ledge of brickwork and was
shaking the railing vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll hold I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up she went like a monkey climbing the side
of a cage. At the top of this grating there came
an agonizing second in which she felt herself
in danger of toppling over before she gained her
balance on the window ledge above. Her splendid
training served her well. She threw herself
across the stone casing and, for a few seconds,
lay there listening.</p>
<p>Hardly had she dropped noiselessly to the
floor, some three feet below, than she heard the
thud-thud of hurrying footsteps on the hard-packed
snow. Holding her breath, she crouched
there motionless, hoping beyond hope that she
might hear those footsteps pass on around the
building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>In this hope she was disappointed. Like a
hound who has lost his scent, the man doubled
back, then paused beneath her window.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s heart raced on. Was she trapped?
The man, she felt sure, would, somehow, gain
access to the building. Nevertheless, she might
escape him.</p>
<p>The building had once been a museum, the
central building of a great world exposition. No
longer used as a museum, it stood there, an immense,
unused structure, slowly dropping into
decay. The floor on which she had landed was
really a broad balcony with a rusty railing at its
edge. From where she crouched she could see
down into the main floor where stretched, twining
and inter-twining, mile upon mile of rooms
and corridors.</p>
<p>Slipping out of her shoes, she buttoned them
to her belt, then stole noiselessly along the balcony.
Moving ever in the shadow of the wall,
she came to a rusty iron stair. Here she paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Would the stair creak, give her away? The
man might at this moment be in the building on
the ground floor. Yet, on this narrow balcony,
she was sure sooner or later to be trapped. She
must risk it.</p>
<p>Placing one trembling foot on the top step,
she allowed her weight to settle upon it. There
followed no sound. Breathing more easily, she
began the descent. Only once did her heart
stand still; a bit of loose plaster, touched by her
foot, bounded downward.</p>
<p>She dared not pause. The die was cast.</p>
<p>Once on the ground floor, she sprang across
a patch of light and found herself in the
shadows once more.</p>
<p>Moving with the greatest possible speed, yet
with even greater caution, avoiding bits of plaster,
rustling papers and other impediments in
her course, she made her way along a wall which
to her heightened imagination seemed to stretch
on for a mile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Once as she paused she thought she caught
the sound of heavy breathing, followed by a dull
thud. &ldquo;Must have come in through my window,&rdquo;
she decided, and, indeed there appeared to
be no other means of access; all the ground floor
doors and windows were either heavily shuttered
or grated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These shutters and gratings,&rdquo; she told herself,
trying to still the fear in her heart by thinking
of other things, &ldquo;are relics of other days.
Here millions of dollars worth of relics, curios,
and costly jewels were once displayed. Mounted
animals and birds, aisle after aisle of them,
rooms full of rich furs and costly silks, jewels
too in abundance. They&rsquo;re all gone now, but the
shutters are still here and I am trapped. There&rsquo;s
only one exit and that guarded. Well, perhaps
another somewhere. Anyway, I can wait. Daylight
drives wolves to their dens. If only I can
reach the other balcony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been in the building in the days of
its glory, and had visited one of the curators, a
friend of her mother. There were, on this other
balcony, she remembered, a perfect labyrinth of
rooms&mdash;cubbyholes and offices. Once she gained
access to these she probably would be safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>But here was another stair. She must go up.</p>
<p>Only partially enshrouded in darkness, it
might betray her.</p>
<p>Dropping on hands and knees, she began to
climb. A bit of glass cut her stocking. She did
not notice that. A crumpled sheet of paper fluttered
away; that was maddening. A broad patch
of light from far above her head threw her out
in bold relief for a second. For a second only.
Then, leaping to her feet, she raced down the
balcony and again entered the shadows.</p>
<p>Pressing a hand to her breast to still her
heart&rsquo;s wild beating, she listened intently.</p>
<p>Did she hear? Yes, there could be no mistake,
there came a soft pit-pat, the footsteps of a person
walking on tiptoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like one of those mounted tigers come to
life,&rdquo; she thought with a shudder.</p>
<p>Slowly she moved along the wall. If only she
could reach a door! If she only could!</p>
<p>But that door was a distance of some fifty
yards away. Could she make it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Stealthily she moved forward. Stopping now
and then to listen, she caught as before the
stealthy pit-pat of footsteps. Once some object
rattled on the floor and she heard a muffled
exclamation. Then she caught a creaking sound&mdash;was
he mounting the stair? Had the banister
creaked?</p>
<p>Now she was twenty yards from the door,
now ten, now five, and now&mdash;now she gripped
its casing. Excitedly she swung around, only
to find herself facing a rusted square of steel.
The labyrinth of rooms was closed to her. She
was trapped on a narrow balcony with no way
to turn for escape.</p>
<p>As she crouched there trembling, her hand
touched something cold&mdash;her skate. Here was
hope; if the worst came to worst, here was a
formidable weapon and she was possessed of the
power to swing it.</p>
<p>Cautiously she drew it from her belt, then
crouching low, gripping the small end, she
waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Came again the pit-pat-pit-pat. He was on
the balcony, she felt sure of that now. Her hand
gripped the skate until the blade cut through the
skin, but still she crouched there waiting.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>When Florence failed to return, Marian and
Lucile might have been seen pacing the floor
while Marian pretended to study and made a
failure of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should go out and look for her,&rdquo;
said Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably just a bit overcome by the wonderful
skating in the moonlight,&rdquo; answered Marian,
in what was intended as an unworried tone,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll go down to the lagoon and have a
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait just a moment,&rdquo; said Lucile as she disappeared
inside her laboratory. When she returned,
something beneath her coat bulged, but
Marian did not ask her what it might be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>After dropping down the rope ladder they
hurried along the beach and across the park to
the lagoon. From the ridge above it they could
see the greater part of the lagoon&rsquo;s surface.
Not a single moving figure darkened its surface.
For fully five minutes they stood there, looking,
listening. Then Marian led the way to the edge
of the ice.</p>
<p>By the side of a clump of bushes she had
spied something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pair of men&rsquo;s rubbers,&rdquo; replied Lucile kicking
at them.</p>
<p>For a full moment the two stood and stared
at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she isn&rsquo;t down here,&rdquo; said Lucile at
last. &ldquo;Perhaps we had better go up and look
among the boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently they walked back to where the hundred
boats were looming in the dark, their masts
like slender arms reaching for the moon. As
they rounded a small schooner, they were
startled by a footstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. It is only I,&rdquo; called a
friendly voice. &ldquo;Out for a stroll in the moonlight.
Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Marian recognized the young man of the
schooner, Mark Pence. She had talked with him
once before. He had helped her home with her
two dozen cans of label-less fruits and vegetables.
Having liked him then, she decided to
trust him now, so in a few well-chosen words
she confided their fears for their companion&rsquo;s
safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all
right. She&rsquo;ll show up all right. Probably went
farther than she intended. But&mdash;sure, I&rsquo;ll take
a turn with you through our little village of
boats. Be glad to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wandered in and out among the various
crafts. Scarcely a word was spoken until they
came to the great black bulk of the scow inhabited
by the Chinamen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rout &rsquo;em out. Might know something,&rdquo;
said Mark.</p>
<p>He knocked several times but received no response.
He was about to enter when Lucile
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. Were&mdash;were you in the
war?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A trifle. Not to amount to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know how to use a gas mask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, rather. Six seconds is my record.
Know that old joke about the &lsquo;quick and the
dead,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you? I was quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile smiled. She was holding out an oblong
package fastened to a strap, also a small glass
bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take&mdash;take these,&rdquo; she whispered nervously.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell about those folks. Break
the bottle if they go after you, then put on the
mask. It&rsquo;s pretty powerful gas but does no
permanent injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark smiled as he slipped the strap over his
shoulder. &ldquo;Nonsense, I guess,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;but might not be. Just like going over the top,
you never can tell.&rdquo; He drew a small flashlight
from his pocket, then pushed the door open.</p>
<p>He was gone for what to the girls seemed an
exceedingly long time. When he returned he
had little enough to tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul in the place, far as I could see,&rdquo;
he reported. &ldquo;But, man, Oh, man! It&rsquo;s a queer
old cellar. Smells like opium and chop-suey.
And talk about narrow winding stairs! Why,
I bet I went down&mdash;&rdquo; He paused to stare at
the scow. &ldquo;Why that tub isn&rsquo;t more than ten
feet high and I went down a good twenty feet.
Rooms and rooms in it. Something queer about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were too anxious for Florence&rsquo;s
safety to give much attention to what he was
saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are greatly obliged to you,&rdquo; said
Lucile, taking her bottle and gas mask. &ldquo;I
guess there&rsquo;s nothing to do but go back to the
yacht and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a friendly good-night they turned and
made their way back to the O Moo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />A CATASTROPHE AVERTED</h2>
<p>As Florence crouched in the dark corner of
the deserted museum, many and wild were the
thoughts that sped through her mind. Could
she do it? If worse came to worst, could she
strike the blow? She had the power; the
muscles of her arm, thanks to her splendid training,
were as firm as those of a man. Yes, she
had the power, but could she do it? There could
be no mincing matters. &ldquo;Strike first and ask
questions after,&rdquo; that must be her motto in such
an extremity. There would be ample opportunity.
A beast always hunts with nose close
to the ground. The man would be a fair mark.
The skate was as perfect a weapon as one might
ask. Keen and powerful as a sword, it would
do its work well. Yet, after all, did she have the
nerve?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>While this problem was revolving in her mind,
the pit-pat of footsteps grew more and more
distinct. Her heart pounded fearfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
coming&mdash;coming&mdash;coming!&rdquo; it seemed to be
repeating over and over.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, there flashed through her
mind the consequences of the blow she must
strike. The man must be given no chance to
fight; one blow must render him unconscious.
Whatever was done must be done well. But
after that, what? She could not leave him alone
in this great, deserted shell of a building.
Neither could she await alone his return to consciousness.
No, that would never do. She
would be obliged to seek aid. From whom? The
police, to be sure. But then there would be a
court scene and a story&mdash;just such a story as
cub reporters dote on. She saw it all in print:
&ldquo;Three girls living in a boat. One pursued by
villain. An Amazon, this modern girl, she brains
him with her skate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Yes, that would make a wonderful news story.
And after that would come such publicity as
would put an end to their happy times aboard
the O Moo. That would mean the end of their
schooldays, just when they were becoming engrossed
in their studies; when they had just
begun to realize the vast treasures of knowledge
which was locked up in books and the brains of
wise men and which would be unlocked to them
little by little, if only they were able to remain
at the university.</p>
<p>The whole thing was unthinkable. She must
escape. She must not strike the blow. There
must be another way out. Yet she could think
of none. Before her was an iron railing, but to
go over this meant a drop of twenty feet. Beyond
her at the end of the balcony, towered a
brick wall; at her back, an iron door. To her
left there sounded ever more plainly the pit-pat
of tiptoeing feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must! I must!&rdquo; she determined, her teeth
set hard. &ldquo;There is no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, even as she expected to hear the shift
of feet which told of a turn on the balcony,
some ten feet from where she cowered, the pit-pat
went steadily forward. She could not believe
her ears. What had happened?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Then on the heels of this revelation, there followed
another: The sound of the footsteps was
growing fainter. Of a sudden the truth dawned
upon her: The man was not on the balcony. He
had not ascended the stairs. He was still on
the floor below. Her sense of location had been
distorted by the vast silence of the place. She
was for the moment safe.</p>
<p>A wave of dizziness swept over her. She sank
into a crumpled heap on the floor. Reviving,
she was seized with an almost uncontrollable desire
to laugh, but, clenching and unclenching her
hands, she maintained an unbroken silence. At
length, her nerves in hand once more, she settled
down to watchful waiting. With eyes and ears
alert, she caught every new move of the prowler.</p>
<p>As the sound of his footsteps died away in
the distance, she settled herself to calmer
thoughts. This place she was in was a vast
cathedral of gloom. When the moon went under
a cloud, blotting out the broad circle of light
which fell from the vaulted dome, the darkness
was so profound that she felt she must scream
or flee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Yet there was something magnetic about the
place. She might have been held there even
though she were not pursued. It was a place
to dream of. Some twenty-eight years before a
hundred thousand people in a single day had
passed in and out along the aisles of this vast
structure. That had been in the days of its
glory. All&mdash;the rich, the poor, the cultured,
the illiterate, the laborer, the street gamin&mdash;had
peered at the marvels displayed between its
walls. And now&mdash;now two beings haunted its
vast corridors, the one pursuing the other. How
strange life was!</p>
<p>A whiff of wind sweeping over the main floor
sent a whirl of waste paper flying in circles halfway
to the ceiling. Two tiny red eyes peered
at her at a safe distance&mdash;then another and
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Three of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The pit-pat of feet became distinct again.
Putting out her hand to grip the skate, she discovered
that her fingers were too stiff for
service. She had grown cold without sensing it.
Rubbing her hands together, she warmed them.
Her limbs too had grown stiff. Rising silently,
she went through a series of exercises which
sent the blood coursing through her veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must get out of here some way,&rdquo; she told
herself, &ldquo;but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly she thought of the girls. They
would be anxious about her, might come out to
seek her, only to fall into a trap.</p>
<p>A trap? She thought of Lucile, slim, nervous.
Lucile hovering as she had in the corner of that
old Mission on that other night; thought too of
the things Lucile had seen there; admired the
nerve she had displayed.</p>
<p>But what did it all mean? She could but feel
that it all was connected in some way; the note
of warning tacked to the schooner; Lucile&rsquo;s
experience in the Mission and her present one,
all fitted together in one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>What was it all about? Were they innocently
checkmating, or appearing to checkmate, some
men in their attempt to perform some unlawful
deed? Were these persons moonshiners, gamblers,
smugglers, or robbers living in the dry
dock? If so, who were they?</p>
<p>Again the sound of footsteps grew indistinct
in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to be getting out of here,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Getting late&mdash;horribly late and&mdash;and
cold. The girls will be searching for me.
There&rsquo;s an open window over there to my right.
Terribly high up, but I might make the ground
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened intently, but caught no sound.
Then stealthily, step by step, she made her way
toward the window.</p>
<p>Now she was fifty feet away from it, now
thirty, now ten. And now&mdash;now she dropped
silently to the floor and crept to the opening.
There was no glass; she was glad of that. Flattening
herself out, she peered over the sill to
the void below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Terribly far down. Easily thirty feet!&rdquo; she
breathed. &ldquo;Two gratings; rotten too, perhaps.
Ground frozen too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached far down and, gripping the top
of the nearest window grating, threw all her
strength into an effort to wrench it free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one&rsquo;s strong enough,&rdquo; she concluded;
&ldquo;but how about the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she lay quite still, listening. In the
distance she fancied she caught the pit-pat again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better try it while I&rsquo;ve got a chance,&rdquo; she
decided.</p>
<p>With the care and skill of a trained athlete
she swung herself over the window sill, clung
to the grating with her toes; dropped down;
gripped the grating with her hands; slid her feet
to the grating below; tested that as best she
could; trusted her weight to it; swung low;
touched the ground; then in her stocking-feet
sped away toward the nearest street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Arrived at a clump of bushes which skirted
the street, she sat down and drew on her shoes.
Then with a loud &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; she crossed the
street and made her way toward the O Moo over
a roundabout but safe route, which led her by
the doors of closed shops and beneath huge
apartments where some of Chicago&rsquo;s thousands
were sleeping.</p>
<p>Her mind, as she hurried on, was deep in the
mystery and full of possible plans as to the
uncertain future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she mumbled once, &ldquo;we should
give up the O Moo. Most people would say it
was a wild notion, this living on a ship, but
what&rsquo;s one to do? No rooms you can pay for,
and who would give up a university education
without a fight? What have we done? What
are these people bothering us for anyway?
What right have they? Who are they anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cast her into deeper reflections. The face
she had seen was not that of Mark Pence.
Whether it was one of the Orientals living on
the scow, or one of the fishermen living in their
fishing smack, she could not tell. She had never
seen the fishermen. Even Marian had seen but
two of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might not be any of these,&rdquo; she concluded
with a shrug. &ldquo;Might have been some night
prowler who will never come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>The two girls in the cabin of the O Moo had
waited an hour. Lucile had fallen half-asleep.
Marian had lifted a trap door and had started
the small gasoline-driven generator which furnished
them light and heat. The engine was
racing away with a faint pop-pop-pop, when Lucile
sat up suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marian,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what did that boy
say about the scow those Chinese people live in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Marian, wrinkling her brow,
&ldquo;he said something about going down twenty
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems strange, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Lucile
considered for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but then it was a winding stairway.
Probably he isn&rsquo;t used to that kind. Perhaps he
just thought it was farther down than it really
was. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile, starting
up. There had come a muffled sound from below,
barely heard above the pop-pop of the
engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>In a second Marian had stopped the generator.
Each girl strained her ears to listen. It came
again, this time more distinct; tap-tap-tap, a
pause, then a fourth tap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile springing for
the door.</p>
<p>Three taps, a halt, then a tap was the signal
for lowering the rope-ladder.</p>
<p>A moment later Florence was being dragged
into the cabin and ordered to give an account of
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a long
story. When I&rsquo;m through you&rsquo;ll very likely be
for leaving the O Moo in the morning, and I&rsquo;m
not so sure but that is the right thing to do.
The cruise of the O Moo,&rdquo; she laughed a bit
uncertainly, &ldquo;gives some indication of turning
out to be an ill-fated voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Lucile and Marian listening intently
Florence told her story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; said Lucile, when she had finished,
&ldquo;do&mdash;do you suppose that has anything
to do with the old Mission affair I told you
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the warning tacked on our hull?&rdquo; suggested
Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Florence thoughtfully,
&ldquo;It might. The point really is, though, are we
leaving in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was answered by an emphatic:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Lucile a few moments
later as she sipped a cup of hot chocolate and
nibbled at a wafer, &ldquo;I peeped into that room in
the old Mission yesterday. The shutter had
been replaced but I could see through the cracks.
There really wasn&rsquo;t anything on the table. The
candles and crucifix were there, but nothing on
the old table&mdash;not anything at all. I&mdash;I must
just have imagined that face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; said Florence mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile suddenly, &ldquo;You were
going to tell me the story that face reminded you
of&mdash;the story told by an old seaman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;but not to-night.
Just look,&rdquo; she sprang to her feet, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s after
three o&rsquo;clock and to-day is already to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />THE BLUE GOD</h2>
<p>As Florence returned from her lectures the
following afternoon she passed across the end
of the lagoon.</p>
<p>Once she had found her skate, lost on the previous
night, and thrust it into the bag with her
books, she glanced up at the ragged giant of a
building which lay sleeping there on its blanket
of snow. She felt an almost irresistible desire
again to enter and roam about its deserted
corridors.</p>
<p>Walking to the corner beneath the broken
windows, she glanced to the right and left of her,
allowed her gaze to sweep the horizon, then, seeing
no one who might observe her actions, she
sprang upon the edge of the wall, scaled the
grating with the agility of a squirrel, tumbled
over the upper window sill and found herself
once more inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>In spite of the fact that it was now broad
daylight and would be for an hour, she found
her heart fluttering painfully. The experiences
of the previous night were all too freshly burned
on the tissues of her brain.</p>
<p>As she tiptoed down the balcony, then dropped
from step to step to the main floor below, the
unpleasant sensations left her. She found herself
walking, as she had some years before as a
child, in the midst of a throng, exclaiming at
every newly discovered monster or thing of delicate
beauty. The treasures had long since been
removed to newer and more magnificent quarters,
but the memory of them lingered.</p>
<p>She was wandering along thus absorbed when
her foot touched something. Thinking it but a
stray brick or crumbling bit of plaster, she was
about to bestow upon it only a passing glance
when, with a sudden exclamation, she stooped
and picked it up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>The thing at first sight appeared to be but a
bundle of soiled silk cloth of a peculiar blue tint.
Florence knew, however, that it was more than
that, for when her toe had struck it, she had
thought it some solid object.</p>
<p>With trembling fingers she tore away the silk
threads which bound it, to uncover a curious
object of blue stone shaped like a short, squat
candlestick. Indeed, there were traces of tallow
to be seen in the cuplike hollow at the top of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it might be blue jade,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;If it is, it&rsquo;s worth something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whisper died on her lips. A thought had
come to her, one which made her afraid of the
gathering darkness, and caused her to hastily
thrust the thing into the pocket of her coat and
hurry from the building.</p>
<p>That night, after the dinner dishes were
washed, Florence, who had been fumbling with
something in the corner, suddenly turned out the
lights. Scratching a match, she lighted the half
of a candle which she had thrust into the candlestick
she had found in the museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather round, children,&rdquo; she said solemnly.</p>
<p>Placing the candle on the floor, she sat down
tailor-fashion before it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gather round,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;and you shall
hear the tale of the strange blue god. It is told
best while seated in the floor as the Negontisks
sit, with legs crossed. It is told best by the dim
and flaring light of a candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile, dropping
down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you get the odd candlestick?&rdquo;
asked Marian as she followed Lucile. &ldquo;What a
strange thing it is; made of some almost transparent
blue stone. And see! little faces peer
out at you from every angle. It is as if a hundred
wicked fairies had been bottled up in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that Marian had said was true, and even
Florence stared at it a long time before she
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found it in the old museum. Probably left
behind when the displays were moved out. I
ought to take it down to the new museum and
ask them, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in Florence&rsquo;s tone
which told Lucile that she herself did not believe
half she was saying but she did not give voice
to those thoughts. Instead she whispered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, let us have the story of the blue
god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the old seaman told it to me,&rdquo; said
Florence, &ldquo;it was like this: He had been shanghaied
by a whaler captain whose ship was to
cruise the coast of Arctic Siberia. So cruel and
unjust was this captain that the sailor resolved
to escape at the first opportunity. That opportunity
came one day when he, with others, had
been sent ashore on the Asiatic continent somewhere
between Korea and Behring Straits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slipping away when no one was looking, he
hid on the edge of a rocky cliff until he saw the
whaler heave anchor and sail away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first it seemed to him that he had gone
from bad to worse; the place appeared to be
uninhabited. It was summer, however, and there
were solman berries on the tundra and blueberries
in the hills. There were an abundance
of wild birds&rsquo; eggs to be gathered on the ledges.
The meat of young birds was tender and good;
so he fared well enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, not forgetting that summer would soon
pass and his food supply be gone, he made his
way southward until at last he came within sight
of the camp fires of a village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was with much fear that he approached
these strangers. He found them friendly
enough, ready to share food and shelter with
him providing he was willing to share their
labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t care to hear of his life among
these natives. Only the part relating to the blue
god is of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He found that these people worshipped a
strange god, or idol. This idol was a very ugly
face carved out of a block of solid blue jade.
When being worshipped it was always illumined
by some strange light which caused it to appear
to smile and frown at alternating intervals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile leaned over and gripped the speaker&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;See how the faces in the candlestick
smile and frown,&rdquo; she shuddered.</p>
<p>Florence smiled and nodded, then proceeded
with her story:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Little by little, as these people who called
themselves Negontisks, who lived in skin tents
and traveled in skin boats as the Eskimos do,
and are considered by some to be the forefathers
of the Eskimos, came to have confidence in the
seaman, they told him the story of the blue god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So ancient was this god that not the oldest
man in the village could recall the time when
it had first been accepted as their god. They
did know, however, that one time when there
were but five villages of their tribe, and when
all these villagers had joined in a great feast
of white whale meat and sour berries, on a slope
at the foot of a great mountain a huge rock had
come rattling down from the cliffs above and,
passing through their midst, had crushed to
death five of their number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As is the custom with most barbaric tribes,
these people considered that anything which had
the power to destroy them must be a god. This
rock, which proved to be of blue jade, became
their god. And that they might have it ever
with them as they traveled, that it might protect
them and bring them good fortune, they
carved from it five hollow faces, like masks.
One of these was taken by each village. Then
they went their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;From that day, so the story goes, the Negontisk
people were greatly prospered. They
found food in abundance. No longer were there
starving times. They had children in numbers
and all these lived to grow to manhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the tribe grew, they wished to create new
villages. They returned to the place of the rock
for new gods, only to find that the rock had
vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their medicine men explained that, being a
god, the rock had the power of going where it
pleased. So there could be only five blue gods.
But the people lived on and prospered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As the years passed, many cruel practices
grew up in connection with the worship of these
gods. Some of them are so terrible that the old
seaman would not tell me of them. One, however,
he did tell; that was that all the illuminations
of the gods were held in a tent made of
many thicknesses of skins. Only men were permitted
to be present during the illumination.
The life of a woman or child who chanced to
look into the tent at such a time must be sacrificed.
Their blood must be spilled before the
face of the blue god. Very strange sort of&rdquo;&mdash;she
broke off abruptly, to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lucile, what makes you tremble so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess.&rdquo; Lucile tried to smile
but made a poor attempt at it. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s ridiculous,
I know,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;but you know
I saw a blue face illumined and I am a girl,
so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Pure nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Marian.
&ldquo;You are in America, Chicago. This
story comes from Siberia. Probably not one
of those tribesmen has ever set foot on the
American continent, let alone in Chicago. And
if they did, do you suppose for a moment that
our authorities would allow them to continue
to perform these terrible religious rites?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was silent.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lucile whispered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the room was silent. Only the
faint tick-tick of the clock in the wall disturbed
the stillness. Then, faintly from outside there
sounded a sort of metallic jingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone out there, below,&rdquo; whispered Marian.
&ldquo;He has kicked that tin can I threw out
there; the third can of corn, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was a faint &ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; Then again
all was silence.</p>
<p>Two or three moments had elapsed when there
came a faint scratching sound, seemingly upon
the side of the yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last time,&rdquo; said Marian, setting her teeth
tight, &ldquo;he got away with his note tacking. This
time he shall not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiptoeing down the room without the least
sound, she climbed upon her berth, which was
made up for the night. By propping herself
upright on her knees she could just see through
a small, circular window. This window was
directly opposite the opening made by propping
up the canvas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Florence had placed herself between Marian
and the candle. No light fell upon Marian to
betray her presence. When one is in a dark
room at night, he may peer into the moonlit
outer world without being seen. Marian had
poised there motionless for a full moment when,
without altering her position other than turning
her head, she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucile, bring me that bottle of gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Understanding at once what bottle was meant,
Lucile tiptoed down the length of the room, managed
to open the laboratory door without noise,
then put her hand to the shelf where the &ldquo;Quick
Action Gas&rdquo; was kept.</p>
<p>With this in her hand she returned to Marian.
She whispered as she passed it up to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful not to drop it in here. It would
drive us all out and we&rsquo;re hardly dressed for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Shrugging her shoulders beneath her dressing
gown, Marian placed the bottle on the blankets,
then reached for the catch which kept the
window closed. This window was seldom
opened and she was not sure but that the unused
hinges would give out a rusty squeak. In
this case her purpose would be thwarted. She
could but try.</p>
<p>Catching her breath, she turned the handle,
then gave a slight pull. To her immense relief,
there came no sound as the window swung
inward. Seizing the bottle, she brought her
hand even with her head, then sat poised there
quite motionless as if impersonating the statue
of a hand-grenade thrower.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, her whole body became tense.
The hand holding the bottle flew back. It shot
forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</h2>
<p>When they saw Marian&rsquo;s hand go back for
the throw, the two other girls, their fear overcome
by curiosity, sprang silently to a position
beside their companion.</p>
<p>What they saw made them draw back in
fright. Two rounds of a ladder extended above
the outer rim of the boat. Above the last round
appeared a face. This face, though almost completely
hidden by a heavy muffler, was undoubtedly
that of a man.</p>
<p>Before they had time to move, however, they
saw the bottle of liquid gas strike the top rail
and burst. The liquid spattering over the man&rsquo;s
face and clothing, brought forth a sharp exclamation.
The next instant, seeming to struggle
against an invisible foe, he made desperate attempts
to dismount from his lofty position. In
this he was partially successful. He disappeared
from sight. But the next moment there
came the thud of a falling body. The ladder
was still in position. The three girls held their
breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He fell,&rdquo; said Lucile in a tremulous whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Lucile interrupted. &ldquo;No
one wishes a person seriously injured.&rdquo; Lucile
shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Florence,
&ldquo;for there he is. The gas is working splendidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was dancing about below, swinging
his arms and shouting madly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a drunken man,&rdquo; whispered Marian,
with a frightened laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be over it in a minute,&rdquo; said Lucile.
&ldquo;Liquid&rsquo;s all over his clothes&mdash;keeps evaporating
and getting into his lungs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to Lucile&rsquo;s prophecy, the man, a few moments
later, having calmed down, appeared to
pause to consider. It was evident that he
wavered between two opinions. Twice he started
in the direction of the ship, each time sending
cold chills creeping up Lucile&rsquo;s spine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have no more gas,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it sulphuric acid this time!&rdquo; Marian
whispered savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! You couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Lucile shuddered.</p>
<p>Pausing each time, the man turned back. The
second time he wheeled about and, racing
madly down the beach, disappeared beyond a
long line of pleasure boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Florence, gathering her dressing
gown about her and springing through the
window, &ldquo;we have a ladder. Looks like a
good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a good one!&rdquo; she exclaimed a moment
later, &ldquo;a brand new one. We&rsquo;ll show it to
Timmie. Perhaps it will serve as evidence to
trap the rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of rascals,&rdquo; said Marian a few moments
later as they sat looking at one another
in silence, &ldquo;what do you think is the meaning
of all this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he came for the blue candlestick,&rdquo;
Lucile suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he?&rdquo; demanded Florence. &ldquo;How
would he know we had it? What would he
want of it? It&rsquo;s only a curio. Belongs to the
museum, I guess. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll see to-morrow.
I&rsquo;m going to take it to the new museum and
show it to one of the curators, a Mr. Cole.
I met him at a party on the campus a short
while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Lucile sprang to her feet, then
rushed to the other end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to prepare some more gas,&rdquo; Lucile
called back over her shoulder. &ldquo;Nothing like
having a little chemist in the family these days.
Gas is almost as useful in times of peace as it
was in the days of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning Marian showed the ladder to
the aged dry dock keeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said after examining it carefully,
&ldquo;I never saw that before. It&rsquo;s new and not very
heavy. Probably bought for the purpose and
carried here. You say you didn&rsquo;t see the man&rsquo;s
face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t recognize him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go round and see the folks close
to here that sell ladders, but I guess it won&rsquo;t
be any use. There&rsquo;s too many places where you
can get ladders in a big city like this. He might
&rsquo;a&rsquo; stole it too. Mighty queer!&rdquo; He shook
his head as he walked away.</p>
<p>That same day Florence wrapped the blue
candlestick carefully in tissue paper, snapped
three rubber bands about it, then made her way
with it to the surface line where she took a car
for down town. She kept a close watch to the
right, to the left and back of her for any signs
of being followed. She scrutinized the faces of
those who entered the car with her and even cast
a glance behind the car to see if there chanced to
be a taxi following.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Truth was, the events of the last hours had
played havoc with her nerves. The candlestick
in her possession was like the presence of some
supernatural thing. It haunted her even in the
day, as a thought of ghosts in a lonely spot at
night might have tormented her.</p>
<p>It was with a distinct sense of relief that,
after leaving the car and passing over a half
mile of board-walk, she entered the massive
door of the new museum.</p>
<p>For a moment, after entering, she permitted
her eyes to roam up and down its vast, high-vaulted
corridors, to catch the echo of voices
which came murmuring to her from everywhere.</p>
<p>She saw the massive pillars, the polished
floors, the miles of glass cases, then a distinct
sense of sorrow swept over her, a feeling of pity
for the ragged giant of a building out by the
lake front which had once housed all these treasures
of beauty, antiquity and wealth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Temporary! Temporary&rdquo; kept running
through her mind. &ldquo;Too hastily built and of
poor material. Now it is abandoned to decay.
Life is like that. That&rsquo;s why one should struggle
to lay foundations, to prepare one&rsquo;s self for life.
For eighteen years, without education, one may
be good enough. Then, like the old museum,
one is cast aside, abandoned to decay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As these thoughts swept through her mind
she resolved more strongly than before, that,
come what might, she would continue her battle
for a university education.</p>
<p>Suddenly recalling her mission, she asked the
attendant to tell her where she might find Mr.
Cole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cole&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; said the man courteously,
&ldquo;is in the left wing, third floor. See those
stairs at the other end of this hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take those stairs. Go to the third floor.
At the last landing go straight ahead. His
door is the fourth to your right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and Florence hurried on her
way.</p>
<p>A moment later she was knocking at the door
of the great archaeologist&rsquo;s studio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Miss Huyler!&rdquo; he exclaimed as
he opened the door to her. &ldquo;Come right in.
What may I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruthaford Cole was one of those rare men
who have studied their subject so thoroughly and
who have traveled so widely in search of further
knowledge that they have no need to assume a
false air of importance and dignity to make an
impression. Under middle age, smooth-shaven,
smiling, he carried the attitude of a boy who
has picked up a few facts here and there and
who is eager to learn more.</p>
<p>But show him a bit of carving from the Congo
and he is all smiles; &ldquo;Oh! Yes, a very nice bit
of modern work. Good enough, but done to sell
to traders. Possesses no historical value, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bit of ivory from the coast of Alaska,
rudely scratched here and there, a hole torn out
here, an end broken off there, browned with
age, is presented and he answers, his face lighting
up with genuine joy, &ldquo;Now there is really
a rare specimen. Handle of a bow-drill; made
long before the white man came, I&rsquo;d say. Tells
stories, that does. Each crudely scratched representation
of reindeer, whale, wolf or bear has
its meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>That was the type of man Cole was. Frank
and friendly to all, he gave evidence in an unassuming
way, of a tremendous fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>Now, as Florence unwrapped the blue candlestick,
he watched the movement of her hands
with much the same look that a terrier wears
when watching his master dig out a rat. Once
the candlestick was in his hand, he held it as
a merchant might a bit of costly and fragile
china-ware.</p>
<p>Florence smiled as she watched him. She had
hoped he would say at first glance: &ldquo;Why,
where did you chance to find that? It was
lost from one of our cases while we were moving!
We believed it stolen.&rdquo; Florence had had
quite enough of adventure and mystery. She
was convinced that holding this trophy she
was sure to experience more trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Mr. Cole did not do the expected thing. What
he did was to turn the candlestick over and
over. A look of amazement spread over his
usually smiling face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two more turns. He held it to the light.
&ldquo;And, yet, it does seem to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping to a door which led to a balcony,
with an absent-minded &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he disappeared
through the door, but Florence could
still see him. As he held the thing to the light,
turning, turning, and turning it again, the look
of amazement grew on his face.</p>
<p>As he re-entered the room, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is! It most certainly is! I am astounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motioning Florence to a seat he dropped into
the swivel chair before his desk. For a moment
he sat staring at the candlestick, then he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me where you
found this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the old museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old museum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought you might have lost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;we never possessed
one of these. There is one in the Metropolitan
Museum. It&rsquo;s the only one I ever saw
save one I chanced upon on the east coast of
Russia. I tried to buy it from the natives. They
would not name a price. Decamped that very
night; utterly disappeared. Thought we might
steal it, I suppose. Suspicious. Superstitious
lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; he said after a moment,
&ldquo;now you have it what are you going to do
with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; smiled Florence, &ldquo;return it to the
owner if&mdash;if he can be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner,&rdquo; Cole&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, &ldquo;I fancy
will not call for it. I have reason to believe
that were you to advertise your find in the
papers he would not venture to call for it. And
yet,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;it might be worth
trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat for a long time in a brown study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Huyler,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;this is
a strange affair. I am not at liberty, at the
present moment, to tell you all I know. One
thing is sure: it is not safe for you to be carrying
this thing about, for in the first place it is
valuable, and in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valuable? That?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite valuable. Well worth stealing. I&rsquo;d
almost be tempted myself,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;But
there is another reason why it is not safe. I
am not at liberty to tell you. But if you will
trust me with it, I will place it in one of the gem
cases. Our gem room is guarded day and night.
It will be safe there, and neither it nor you
will be safe if you keep it. By the way,&rdquo; he
broke off suddenly, &ldquo;what is your address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence gave the address of a friend where
her mail was left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but no mail is delivered where I do live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can that be?&rdquo; he asked in some
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a boat,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;In a pleasure
yacht. Oh, it&rsquo;s not afloat,&rdquo; as he looked at her in
astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might I ask the name of the boat and the
location?&rdquo; he half apologized. &ldquo;Someone might
wish to visit you. It will be proper and very
important that he should. Otherwise I would
not ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The O Moo,&rdquo; answered Florence quietly.
&ldquo;Foot of 71st Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose to go. He grasped her hand for a
second, looking as if he would like to say more,
then bowed her out of the door.</p>
<p>As she entered the corridor, she was conscious
of a strange dizziness. It was as if she had
spent the better part of a night poring over an
absorbing story. She had come to the museum
to rid herself of the blue candlestick and the
mystery attached to it. The candlestick was
gone but the mystery lay before her deeper and
darker than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />A STRANGE GAME OF HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK</h2>
<p>The next short chapter in the story of the
mystery of the blue candlestick followed closely
upon Florence&rsquo;s visit to the new museum.</p>
<p>It was on the following morning, as she and
Lucile were strapping up their books preparatory
to leaving the O Moo, that they heard
a sudden loud rapping on the hull of the yacht.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be?&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Florence racing for the door.</p>
<p>Much to her astonishment, as she peered
down over the rail she found herself looking
into the blue eyes of a strapping police sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence Huyler?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do I git up?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Or do you
prefer to come down? Gotta speak with you.
Nothin&rsquo; serious, not for you,&rdquo; he added as he
saw the startled look on her face.</p>
<p>With trembling hand Florence threw the rope
ladder over the rail. As the officer set the ladder
groaning beneath his weight, questions flew
through her mind. &ldquo;What does he want? Will
he forbid us living in the O Moo? What have
we done to deserve a visit from the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a flash Mr. Cole&rsquo;s words came back
to her: &ldquo;Someone else may wish to talk with
you.&rdquo; That someone must be this policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come in?&rdquo; she asked, as the officer&rsquo;s
foot touched the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he began at once, while his keen
eyes roamed from corner to corner of the cabin,
&ldquo;my visit has to do with a bit of a curio you
found lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blue candlestick?&rdquo; suggested Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t know much&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may know more than you think. Now
sit down nice and easy and tell me all you do
know and about all the queer things that have
happened to you since you came to live in this
here boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence seated herself on the edge of her
chair, then told in dramatic fashion of her adventures
in the old museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said the officer emphatically when
she had finished. &ldquo;Queer! Mighty queer, now,
wasn&rsquo;t it? And now, is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucile, my friend here, had a rather strange
experience in the Spanish Mission. Perhaps
she&rsquo;ll tell you of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile&rsquo;s face went first white, then red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that! That was nothing. I&mdash;I went
to sleep and dreamed, I guess. You see,&rdquo; she
explained to the officer, &ldquo;I had been out in the
storm so long, I was sort of benumbed with the
cold, and when I got inside I fell asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; the officer prompted with an
encouraging smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any harm to tell,&rdquo; encouraged
Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Stammering and blushing at first, Lucile
launched into her story. Gaining in confidence
as she went on, she succeeded in telling it very
well.</p>
<p>When she came to the part about the blue
face, in his eagerness to drink in every detail
the officer leaned forward, half rising from his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;You
say it was a blue face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, blue. I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue like the candlestick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;yes, I think it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be any mistake,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself,
as he settled back in his chair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s it,
that&rsquo;s all. Wouldn&rsquo;t I like to have been there!
All right,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile finished her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that all?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All except something that happened the night
Florence was caught in the old museum and
didn&rsquo;t get home,&rdquo; said Lucile, &ldquo;but what happened
wasn&rsquo;t much. You see, we went out to
search for her, and a boy named Mark Pence,
who lives in a boat here too, joined us. We
couldn&rsquo;t rouse anyone at the old scow where the
Chinamen live, so he went in. He didn&rsquo;t find
anyone, but when he came out he said it was
such a queer sort of place. He said there was a
winding stairway in it twenty feet high. But I
guess he doesn&rsquo;t know much about winding stairways,
because the scow is only ten feet high altogether.
So the stairs couldn&rsquo;t be twenty feet
deep, could they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer, who had again half risen from his
chair, settled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no, of course they couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Florence, who had been studying his face,
thought he attached far greater importance to
this last incident than his words would seem to
indicate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
going. You&rsquo;ve shed a lot of light upon a very
mysterious subject; one which has been bothering
the whole police force. I&rsquo;m from the 63d
street station. If anything further happens, let
me know at once, will you? Call for Sergeant
Malloney. And if ever you need any protection
by day or night, the station&rsquo;s at your service.
Good day and thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you think of that?&rdquo; said
Florence as the officer&rsquo;s broad back disappeared
beyond the black bulk of a tug in dry dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; said Lucile.
&ldquo;One thing I&rsquo;m awfully sure of, though,
and that is that living on a boat is more exciting
than one would imagine before trying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Lucile that night as she lay
curled up in her favorite chair, &ldquo;that I could
create something. I wish I could write a story&mdash;a
real story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Then, for a long time she was silent. &ldquo;Professor
Storris,&rdquo; she began again, &ldquo;told us just
how a short story ought to be done. First you
find an unusual setting for your story; something
that hasn&rsquo;t been described before; then
you imagine some very unusual events occurring
in that setting. That makes a story, only
you need a little technique. There must be three
parts to the story. You look about in the story
and find the very most dramatic point in the
narrative&mdash;fearfully exciting and dramatic.
You begin the story right there; don&rsquo;t tell how
things come to be happening so, nor why the
hero was there or anything; just plunge right
into it like: &lsquo;Cold perspiration stood out upon
his brow; a chill ran down his spine. His eyes
were glued upon the two burning orbs of fire.
He was paralyzed with fear&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence looked up and laughed. &ldquo;That
ought to get them interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is,&rdquo; said Lucile thoughtfully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
hard to find an unusual setting and the unusual
incidents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you&rsquo;ve done two or three hundred
words of thrill,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;then you keep
the hero in a most horrible plight while his mind
runs like lightning back over the events which
brought him to this dramatic moment in his
career. Then you suddenly take up the thrill
again and bring the story up to the climax
with a bang. Simple, isn&rsquo;t it? All you have
to do is do it; only you must concentrate, concentrate
tremendously, all the while you&rsquo;re doing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>For a long while after that she lay back in
her chair quite silent, so silent indeed that her
companions thought her asleep. But after nearly
an hour she sprang to her feet with sudden
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it. Three girls living in a yacht
in dry dock. That&rsquo;s an unusual setting. And
the unusual incident, I have that too but I shan&rsquo;t
tell it. That&rsquo;s to be the surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girls were preparing to retire.
Lucile took down her hair, slipped on a loose
dressing-gown, arranged a dark shade over her
lamp, then, having taken a quantity of paper
from a drawer and sharpened six pencils, she
sat down to write.</p>
<p>When she commenced it was ten by the
clock built into the running board at the end of
the cabin. When she came to an end and threw
the last dulled pencil from her it was one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>For a moment she shuffled the papers into
an oblong heap, then, throwing aside her dressing-gown
and snapping off the light, she climbed
to her berth and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>But even in her dreams, she appeared to be
experiencing the incidents of her story, for
now she moved restlessly murmuring, &ldquo;How
the boat pitches!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Listen to the wind
howl!&rdquo; A moment later she sat bolt upright,
exclaiming in a shrill whisper, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ice! I tell
you it&rsquo;s ice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian was the first one up in the morning.
It was her turn for making toast and coffee.
As she passed Lucile&rsquo;s desk she glanced at the
stock of paper and unconsciously read the title,
&ldquo;The Cruise of the O Moo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladly would she have read the pages which
followed but loyalty to her cousin forbade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Lucile at breakfast, &ldquo;I am
going to have my story typed, and next day I
shall take it to the office of the Literary
Monthly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the editor treats you kindly,&rdquo; smiled
Marian. &ldquo;You must remember, though, that
we are only freshmen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>But Lucile&rsquo;s faith in her product, her first
real &ldquo;creation,&rdquo; was not to be daunted. &ldquo;I
did it just as Professor Storris said it should
be done, so I know it must be good,&rdquo; she affirmed
stoutly.</p>
<p>That night Lucile spent an hour working over
the typewritten copy of her story. Tracing in
a word here, marking one out there, punctuating,
comparing, rearranging, she made it as
perfect as her limited knowledge of the story
writing art would permit her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; she sighed, tossing back the
loose-flung hair which tumbled down over her
shapely shoulders, &ldquo;I will take you to ye editor
in ye morning. And here&rsquo;s hoping he treats you
well.&rdquo; She patted the manuscript affectionately,
then stowed it away in a pigeon-hole.</p>
<p>If the truth were to be told, she was due for
something of a surprise regarding that manuscript.
But all that lay in the future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Florence and Marian were away. They had
gone for a spin on the lagoon before retiring.
She was alone on the O Moo. Tossing her
dressing-gown lightly from her she proceeded
to put herself through a series of exercises such
as are calculated to bring color to the cheek
and sparkle to the eye of a modern American
girl.</p>
<p>Coming out of this with glowing face and
heaving chest, she threw on her dressing-gown
and leaped out of the cabin and into the moonlight
which flooded a narrow open spot on deck.</p>
<p>Away at the left she saw the ice on the lake
shore stand out in irregular piles. Here was a
huge pile twenty feet high and there a single
cake on end. There was a whole forest of jagged,
bayonet-like edges and here again pile
after pile lay scattered like shocks of grain in
the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all the world like the Arctic!&rdquo; she
breathed. &ldquo;What sport it would be to play hide-and-go-seek
with oneself out there in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>She paused a moment in thought. Then,
clapping her hands she exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.
It will be like going back to good old Cape Prince
of Wales, in Alaska.&rdquo; Hastening inside, she
twisted her hair in a knot on the top of her
head, drew on some warm garments, crowned
herself with a stocking-cap, and was away toward
the beach.</p>
<p>Since the O Moo was on the track nearest to
the shore, she was but a moment reaching the
edge of the ice which, packed thick between two
breakwaters, lay glistening away in the moonlight.
Here she hesitated. She was not sure it
was quite safe. The wind had been blowing on
shore for days. It had brought the ice-packs in.
Under similar conditions in the Arctic, the ice
would have been solidly frozen together by this
time, but she was not acquainted with lake ice;
it might be treacherous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; she exclaimed at last. &ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s
still onshore; I&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping out upon the first flat cake, she
hurried across it to dodge into the shadow of a
towering pile of broken fragments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch me!&rdquo; she exclaimed joyously aloud.
&ldquo;Catch me if you can!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>She had reverted to the days of her childhood
and was playing hide-and-go-seek with
herself. First behind this pile, then that, she
flitted in the moonlight like a ghost. On and
on, in a zigzag course, she went until a glance
back brought from her lips an exclamation of
surprise: &ldquo;How far I am from the shore!&rdquo;
For a moment she stood quite still. Then the
startled exclamation came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cake of ice tips. It moves! I must
go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Springing from the cake, she leaped upon
another and another. She had just succeeded
in reaching a spot where the rise and fall of
the ice in response to the swells which swept
in from the lake, was lessening, when something
caused her heart to flutter wildly.</p>
<p>Had she seen a dark form disappear behind
that ice-pile off to her right?</p>
<p>In an instant she was hugging the shadow of
a great, up-ended cake. No, she had not been
mistaken. Out of the silence there came the pat-pat
of footsteps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Locating as best she could the position of the
intruder, she sprang away in the opposite direction.
She was engaged in a game of hide-and-go-seek,
not with herself, but with some
other person, a stranger probably. What the
outcome of that game would be she could not
tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />SOMEONE DROPS IN FROM NOWHERE</h2>
<p>Pausing to listen whenever she gained the
protecting shadow of an ice-pile, Lucile caught
each time the pit-pat of footsteps. This so terrified
her that she lost all knowledge of direction,
her only thought to put a greater distance
between herself and that haunting black
shadow.</p>
<p>Suddenly she awoke to her old peril. The ice
beneath her was heaving. Before her lay a dark
patch of water. In her excitement she had
been making her way toward open water. With
a shudder she wheeled about, and forcing her
mind to calmer counsel, chose a circling route
which would eventually bring her to the shore.</p>
<p>Again she dodged from ice-pile to ice-pile,
again paused to hear the wild beating of her
own heart and the pit-pat of the shadow&rsquo;s footfalls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>But what was this? As she listened she
seemed to catch the fall of two pairs of feet.</p>
<p>In desperation she shot forward a great distance
without pausing. When at last she did
pause it was with the utmost consternation that
she realized that not one or two, but many pairs
of feet were dropping pit-pat on the ice floor
of the lake.</p>
<p>As she dodged out for another flight, she saw
them&mdash;three of them&mdash;as they suddenly disappeared
from sight. One to the right, one to
the left, one behind her, they were closing in
upon her.</p>
<p>There was still a space between the two to
right and left. Through this she sprang, only
to see a fourth directly before her. As she
again dodged into a sheltering shadow she
nerved herself for a scream. The girls were
away, but someone, Mark Pence, the fishermen,
old Timmie, might hear and come to her aid.</p>
<p>But what was this? She no longer caught
the shuffle of moving feet. All was silent as
the tomb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>For a moment she hovered there undecided.
Then she caught the distant, even tramp-tramp
of two pairs of heavy, marching feet. Glancing
shoreward, she saw two burly policemen, their
brass buttons gleaming in the moonlight, marching
down the beach. It had been the presence
of these officers which had held her pursuers to
their shadowy hiding-places.</p>
<p>If she but screamed once these officers would
come to her rescue! But she had, from early
childhood, experienced a great fear of policemen.
When she endeavored to scream, her
tongue clung to the roof of her mouth. And
so there she stood, motionless, voiceless, until
the officers had passed from her sight.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>While Lucile was experiencing the strange
thrills of this terrible game out on the lake ice,
Florence and Marian were witnessing mysterious
actions of strange persons out on the lagoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>In spite of the lateness of the hour, there were
a number of persons skating on the north end
of the lagoon, so the two girls experienced no
fear as they went for a quarter-mile dash down
the southern channel which lay between an
island and the shore. At the south end of the
lagoon the channel, which became very narrow,
was spanned by a wooden bridge.</p>
<p>This bridge, even in the daytime, always gave
Marian a shock of something very like fear, for
it was here that a great tragedy ending in the
death of a prominent society woman had
occurred.</p>
<p>Now, as she found herself nearing it, preparing
for a long skimming glide beneath it, she
felt a chill shoot up her spine. Involuntarily
she glanced up at the bridge railing. Then she
gripped Florence&rsquo;s arm tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be on the bridge at this hour
of the night?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably someone who has climbed up there
to take off his skates,&rdquo; said Florence with her
characteristic coolness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look! He&rsquo;s waving his arms. He&rsquo;s
signaling. Do you suppose he means it for us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking north,
toward the edge of the island. Come on; pay no
attention to him. Under we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a great, broad swinging stroke she fairly
threw her lighter partner across the shadow
that the bridge made and out into the moonlight
on the other side.</p>
<p>Marian was breathing quite easily again. They
had made half the length of the island on the
return lap, when she again gripped Florence&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sled!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone was impatient.
&ldquo;You are seeing things to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sled, drawn by two men without skates,
was passing diagonally across the lagoon. It
was seven or eight feet long and stood a full
three feet above the ice. The runners, of solid
boards, were exceedingly broad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange sled,&rdquo; said Marian as they
cut across the path of the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sled seems heavy,&rdquo; remarked Florence. &ldquo;At
least one would think it was by the way they
slip and slide as they pull it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>They had passed a hundred yards beyond that
spot when Florence turned to glance back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Look!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
man sitting on the ice, back there a hundred
yards or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the men with the sled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some skater tightening his strap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t one in sight a moment ago. Tell
you what,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s circle
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian was not keen for this adventure, but
accompanied her companion without comment.</p>
<p>Nothing really came of it, not at that time.
The man sat all humped over on the ice, as if
mending a broken skate. He did not move nor
look up. Florence thought she saw beside him
a somewhat bulky package but could not quite
tell. His coat almost concealed it, if, indeed,
there was a package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men drawing a strange sled,&rdquo; she
mused. &ldquo;One man on the ice alone. Possibly
a package.&rdquo; Turning to Marian she asked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing,&rdquo; said Marian in surprise.
&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Florence
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>There was something to it after all and what
this something was they were destined to learn
in the days that were to follow.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Out among the ice-piles between the breakwaters,
cowering in the shadows too frightened
to scream, Lucile was seeing things. Hardly
had the policemen disappeared behind the boats
on the dry dock than the dark figures began
to reappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so many of them!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>She was tempted to believe she was in a
trance. To the right of her, to the left, before,
behind, she saw them. Ten, twenty,
thirty, perhaps forty darkly enshrouded heads
peered out from the shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As if in a fairy book!&rdquo; she thrilled. &ldquo;What
can it mean? What are all these people doing
out here at this ghostly hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she was seized with a fit of calm,
desperate courage. Gliding from her shadow,
she walked boldly out into the moonlight. Her
heart was racing madly; her knees trembled.
She could scarcely walk, yet walk she did, with
a steady determined tread. Past this ice-pile,
round this row of up-ended cakes, across this
broad, open spot she moved. No one sprang
out to intercept her progress. Here and there
a dark head appeared for an instant, only
immediately to disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;All cowards.
Afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now she was approaching the sandy beach.
Unable longer to restrain her impulses, she
broke into a wild run.</p>
<p>She arrived at the side of the O Moo entirely
out of breath. Leaning against its side
for a moment, she turned to look back. There
was not a person in sight. The beach, the
ice, the black lines of breakwaters seemed as
silent and forsaken as the heart of a desert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it is swarming with men,&rdquo; she
breathed. &ldquo;I wonder what they wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she started. A figure had come
into sight round the nearest prow. For an
instant her hand gripped a round of the ladder,
a preparatory move for upward flight.
Then her hand relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is I, Mark Pence,&rdquo; said a friendly
boyish voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose I should be afraid of you,&rdquo;
said Lucile, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Why should you?&rdquo; he asked with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see everyone about this old dry
dock is so terribly mysterious. I&rsquo;ve just had
an awful fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo; Mark Pence smiled as he
spoke.</p>
<p>Seating herself upon the flukes of an up-ended
anchor she did tell him; told him not
alone of her experience that night, but of the
one of that other night in the Spanish Mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said soberly when she
had finished, &ldquo;there <i>are</i> a lot of mysterious
things happening about this dock. I don&rsquo;t
think it will last much longer, though. Things
are sort of coming to a head. Know what
those two policemen were here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made a call on the Chinks, down there
in the old scow. Came to look for something.
But they didn&rsquo;t find it. Heard them say as
much when they came out. They were mighty
excited about something, though. Bet they
thought it was mighty strange that there was
a stairway in that old scow twenty feet deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you sure about that stairway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s reply was confident:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&rsquo;s I am that I&rsquo;m standing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile protested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But most folks don&rsquo;t use circling stairways
much. They don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do though. I work in a library. There
are scores of circling stairways among the
stacks and I know just how high each one is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> queer about that stairway,&rdquo; Lucile
breathed. &ldquo;I must be going up. I&rsquo;m getting
chill sitting here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye.&rdquo; Mark Pence put out his
hand and seized hers in a friendly grip. &ldquo;Just
remember I&rsquo;m with you. If you ever need
me, just whistle and I&rsquo;ll come running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&mdash;thanks&mdash;aw&mdash;awfully,&rdquo; said
Lucile, a strange catch in her throat.</p>
<p>Her eyes followed him until the boat&rsquo;s prow
had hidden him; then she hurried up the rope-ladder
and into the cabin. She was shivering
all over, whether from a chill or from nervous
excitement she could not tell.</p>
<p>The other girls came in a few moments
later. For an hour they sat in a corner, drinking
hot chocolate and telling of their night&rsquo;s
adventures. Then they prepared themselves
for the night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>For a long time after the others had retired,
Florence sat in a huge upholstered chair,
lights out, staring into the dark. She was
thinking over the experiences of the past few
weeks, trying to put them together in a geometric
whole, just as an artist arranges the parts
of a stained glass window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Lucile&rsquo;s experience in the old
Spanish Mission,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;and my own
in the museum. Then there&rsquo;s Mark Pence&rsquo;s
visit to the old scow and the circular stairway.
Then there&rsquo;s the blue candlestick. It&rsquo;s
rare, mysterious and valuable. Why? The
police are interested in it. Why? Then there&rsquo;s
the police-sergeant&rsquo;s visit, and Lucile&rsquo;s experience
on the ice, and the two policemen visiting
the old scow, and there&rsquo;s that man on the
bridge to-night, the two with the sled and the
one sitting on the ice. It&rsquo;s all mysterious, so
it ought all to fit together somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time she sat wrapped in deep
thought. Then she started suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blue!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The face Lucile
saw in the Mission was blue, illuminated and
blue. In the story the old seaman told me
the face of the god of the Negontisks was illuminated
and blue. The candlestick I found
was blue. What should be more natural than
that a blue jade candlestick should be made
in which to set a candle with which to illumine
the blue god? Blue jade is valuable. A
ring or stickpin set with a small piece of it
is costly. That makes the candlestick both
costly and valuable. All that,&rdquo; she sighed,
&ldquo;seems to hang together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she sat for a time in deep thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; she breathed at last, &ldquo;who ever
heard of a tribe of Negontisks in America,
let alone here in Chicago? Try to imagine
a hundred or more near-savages, with no
money and no means of transportation but
their native skin-boats, traveling eight thousand
miles over land and sea and ending up
in Chicago. It can&rsquo;t be imagined. It simply
isn&rsquo;t done. So there goes my carefully arranged
puzzle all to smash.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Throwing off her dressing-gown, she climbed
into her berth, listening to the flag-rope lashing
the mast for an instant, then fell fast
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />THE REAL CRUISE BEGINS</h2>
<p>Next morning Florence was skating down
the lagoon, deep in thoughts of the mysterious
events of the past few days. So deeply engrossing
were these thoughts that she did not
see what lay before her. Suddenly her skate
struck some solid obstacle. She tripped, then
went sprawling. Her loosened skate shot off
in another direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; she murmured as she sat
up rubbing her knees.</p>
<p>Glancing back over the way she had come,
she saw nothing more than a circular raised
spot which had formed when water had
sprung up through a hole in the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; she mused, and rising,
she hopped and glided back to the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone must have cut a hole in the ice,&rdquo;
she reflected, &ldquo;though what they&rsquo;d do it for
is more than I can see. We youngsters used
to do that to get a drink when we were skating
on a little prairie pond, a long way from
nowhere. But here the ice is fourteen inches
thick and there&rsquo;s a drink of water to be had
for the asking up at the skate house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she glanced down at the spot, another
strange circumstance surprised her. &ldquo;What
makes that spot look so much bluer than the
other ice?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>As she examined it more closely she saw
that this patch of blue had a very definite
outline, but rough and jagged, like the edges
of a piece of cloth haggled by a child who
is just learning to use a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>Having recaptured her fugitive skate, she
clamped it to her foot and was about to go
on her way when another startling fact arrested
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;is just about
where that man was sitting last night; the
one Marian and I saw who had apparently
dropped in from nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>So struck with the discovery was she that
she skated over to the edge of the ice where
the sled drawn by the two strangers had left
the snow. There she took good notice of the
direction in which the sled had been going
when it came upon the ice.</p>
<p>Turning about, she skated backward with
her eyes on the track made by the sled runners.
She was endeavoring to retrace the sled
over the ice where no tracks were visible, in
an effort to prove that the sled had arrived
at the point on the ice where the hole had
been cut when it turned and struck off at another
angle.</p>
<p>So successful was she in this that she all
but fell over the rise in the ice a second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Now for
something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skating rapidly to the end of the lagoon
nearest the dry dock she circulated about until
she discovered the spot at which the sled
had left the ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Again guiding herself by the course taken
by the sled, she skated backward and in a
short time found herself once more beside the
spot in the ice where the hole had been cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves something,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;but just how much I can&rsquo;t tell. But I&rsquo;ll
leave that to study out to-night. Must hurry
on or I&rsquo;ll be late to my lecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sled track went toward the dry
dock,&rdquo; she told herself a few moments later.
&ldquo;To-night when I go home I&rsquo;ll try to trace
it out and see where it went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile was home early that day. Marian
had not gone to school at all. She had stayed
on the beach making sketches of the ice-jam
on the lake front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be going out again to-night,&rdquo; she told
Lucile. &ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s shifted. It&rsquo;s offshore now
and rising. There are certain effects of lights
and shadows which you get on the rim of a
body of fresh water which you don&rsquo;t in the
sea ice. Sea ice is white, dull white, like snow.
Fresh water ice is blue; blue as the sky sometimes.
I want to catch it before it blows out
again. But what brings you home so early,
Lucile?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cut my lecture. Headache,&rdquo; she explained,
pressing her temples. &ldquo;Nothing much though.
And, Marian,&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;what
do you think? That story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The editor of the Literary Monthly? No,
better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could anything be better than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; declaimed Lucile, striking a mock
dramatic attitude. &ldquo;He said, the literary editor
did, that it was too good for his <i>poor
little publication</i>! Fancy! &lsquo;His poor little
publication!&rsquo; My story too good! My story!
A freshman&rsquo;s story!&rdquo; She burst into sudden
laughter, but stopped abruptly and sat down
pressing her temples and groaning: &ldquo;My poor
head!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell about it&mdash;about
stories,&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;Heads either. You&rsquo;ll
have to go to bed early to-night and get a
good night&rsquo;s sleep. There&rsquo;s been entirely too
much excitement on board these last few
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&rdquo; Lucile went on, &ldquo;that the Literary
Monthly didn&rsquo;t pay for stories. Of
course I knew that. And he said that he
thought I could sell my story; that he thought
it was good enough for that. The technique
was not quite perfect. There was too much
explanation at the beginning and the climax
was short, but the theme and plot were unusual.
He thought that would put it over.
He knew exactly the place to send it&mdash;&lsquo;Seaside
Tales,&rsquo; a new magazine just started by
a very successful editor. He knows him personally.
He gave me a letter of introduction
to him and I mailed the story to him right
away. So you see,&rdquo; she smiled folding her
arms, &ldquo;I am to be an authoress, a&mdash;a second
George Eliot, if you please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Seaside Tales is published right down
town. Why did you mail it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said Lucile in real consternation,
&ldquo;that I would dare beard that lion
of an editor in his den? The editor of a real
magazine that pays genuine money for stories?
Why I&mdash;I&rsquo;d die of fright. Besides, one does
not do it. Really one doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was your story about?&rdquo; asked Marian
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t going to tell, but I
guess I will. It was about three girls living
on a yacht in a dry dock. And, one night in
a storm the yacht broke loose on the dry dock
and went out into the water. Then it drifted
out to sea. Then, of course, they had to get
back to land. Wasn&rsquo;t that dramatic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very!&rdquo; smiled Marian. &ldquo;Goodness!
I hope it never happens to the O Moo! Just
think! Not one of us even knows how to start
the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to have Dr. Holmes show me the
very next time he and Mrs. Holmes come
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will. But you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was one time when Lucile was right;
in this queer old world you never can tell.</p>
<p>When Florence returned from the university
the shades of night were already falling. There
was, however, sufficient light to enable her to
follow the track of the sled she had seen the
night before. This track led straight across
the park to the beach, then along the beach
in the direction of the dry dock. A few hundred
yards from the dry dock it turned suddenly
to the left and was at once lost among
the tumbled masses of ice, where no trace of
it could be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sled might be hidden out there,&rdquo; she mused.</p>
<p>For a time she contemplated going out in
search of it. When, however, she realized that
it was growing quite dark, and recalled Lucile&rsquo;s
unpleasant experience of the night before, she
decided not to venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they come back to the beach again,&rdquo; she
told herself, &ldquo;I can pick up their tracks in the
snow farther down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Walking briskly, she covered the remaining
distance to the spot on the beach opposite the
O Moo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; she whispered, and climbing over
the trestle she made her way on down the beach.
Her eyes were always on the ground. Now
she climbed a trestle, now walked round an
anchor frozen into the sand, but always her
eyes returned to the tracks in the snow. Tracks
enough there were, footprints of men, but never
a trace of a sled leaving the ice.</p>
<p>She had gone a considerable distance when
she became conscious of some person not far
away. On looking up she was startled to note
that she had reached a point opposite the great
black scow where the Orientals lived.</p>
<p>At the end of the scow stood a man. His
face disfigured by a scowl, he stood watching
her. He was dressed in the black gownlike
garb of the Chinese. He wore a queue. There
was, however, something strange about his face.
She fancied she had seen him somewhere before,
but where she could not tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Then the man moved out of the light that
shone on him from a window and was swallowed
up by the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use going farther,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;If
the sled belongs on the dry dock somewhere it
would be the easiest thing in the world for two
persons to lift it on their shoulders and carry it
in from the ice. That would throw one completely
off the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, she retraced her steps along the
beach to the trestle work on which the O Moo
rested, then swinging about to the right she
made her way to the yacht&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Once on deck, she made certain that the other
girls were aboard, then retraced her steps to the
deck&rsquo;s side, where she pulled down the canvas
and tied it securely. For a moment she stood
listening to the lash of ropes on the mast. The
canvas covering bulged and sagged. Cool air
fanned her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be a bad storm,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Offshore wind, too. All the ice will go out
to-night, and everything with it that isn&rsquo;t tied
down.&rdquo; When all was tight on deck she slipped
into the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Lucile, who ate very little dinner that night,
retired early. Marian studied until nine-thirty.
The clock pointed at eleven when Florence, with
a sigh of regret, put down her psychology to
prepare for sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;what a storm!
Listen to the canvas boom! Like a schooner
at sea! Hope it doesn&rsquo;t tear the canvas away.
Hope it doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish the sentence. The thought
which had come to her was too absurd.</p>
<p>Once snugly tucked in her bed, she found
her mind returning to the morning&rsquo;s discovery.
What did that new ice on the lagoon
mean? Why had the hole been cut? Why was
the ice blue? Did the sled and the man sitting
on the ice the night before have anything
to do with it? Did the man cut that hole? If
so, why?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>He might, she told herself, have had something
to conceal, some valuables, stolen diamonds
or gold. But how could he hope to recover
it if he dropped it through a hole in the
ice. The water beneath the ice was always
murky and there was a strong current there.
Anything dropped beneath that ice would be
lost forever.</p>
<p>She remembered the two policemen whom Lucile
had seen on the beach that same night.
Perhaps those two men had been running from
the officers, trying to conceal something. But
how had the man come there on the ice? Perhaps&mdash;she
started at the thought&mdash;perhaps
this man rode there beneath the sled. The runners
had been extraordinarily broad. A man
could easily ride between them. The thought
gave her a start.</p>
<p>She thought of Lucile&rsquo;s experience in the old
Mission, and of her own with the blue candlestick.
Perhaps, she told herself, they dropped
the blue god through the ice.</p>
<p>Then she smiled at herself. How could the
blue god be in Chicago? If it were they would
never drop it in the water beneath the ice where
it could never be recovered. Yet why had the
ice been blue? Why&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>She fell asleep, to listen in her dreams to the
lash of ropes, the boom of canvas and to dream
of riding a frail craft on a storm-tossed sea.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to determine just why it
is that one knows how long he has slept, yet we
very often do know. One wakens in the middle
of the night and before the clock strikes the
hour he says to himself, &ldquo;I have slept three
hours.&rdquo; And he is right.</p>
<p>When Florence awoke that night she knew
she had been asleep for about five hours. It
was dark, pitch dark, in the cabin. The storm
was still raging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just listen,&rdquo; she murmured dreamily, &ldquo;One
could easily imagine that we were out to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tremendous booming of canvas
and a lashing sound which resembled the wash
of the waves, but this last, she told herself, was
the ropes beating the mast. She had dozed off
again when some strange element of the storm
brought her once more half awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One would almost say the yacht was pitching,&rdquo;
she thought as in a dream, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s
firmly fastened. It is impossible. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she sat up fully awake. She had
moved a trifle closer to the porthole. Her head
had been banged against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> pitching!&rdquo; she exclaimed in an awed
whisper.</p>
<p>Her mind whirled. What had happened?
Was the storm so violent that the O Moo was
being rocked from side to side on her trestle.
Would she soon topple over, to go crashing on
the frozen sand? Or had they in some way been
blown out to sea?</p>
<p>This last seemed impossible. She thought of
the block beneath the wheels of the car on
which the O Moo stood, then of the strong
cable fastened to her prow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> impossible!&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>There was one way to prove this. She proceeded
to apply the test.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Turning a screw which held her porthole
closed, she swung the metal framed glass wide
open.</p>
<p>Instantly she slammed it shut. She had been
soaked with a perfect deluge of water.</p>
<p>Her heart stopped beating. She tried to shout
to the other girls, but her tongue clung to the
roof of her mouth. There could no longer be
any doubt concerning the nature of the catastrophe
which had come over them. How it had
happened, she could not even guess. This much
she knew: <i>They were afloat.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls! Girls!&rdquo; Her own voice shouted to her
like that of a ghost, &ldquo;Marian! Lucile! Wake
up! We&rsquo;re afloat! The O Moo&rsquo;s adrift!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian groaned; sat up quickly, then as
quickly fell back again. Her head had collided
with a beam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>There came a low moan from Lucile: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seasick. Poor child,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, not that.&rdquo; Lucile&rsquo;s voice was
faint. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my head&mdash;it&rsquo;s splitting. I can&rsquo;t
raise it. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s going to be&mdash;be&mdash;bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence leaped to the floor. Her feet splashed
into a thin sheet of water which washed about
on the carpet. The cold chill of it brought her
to her senses. They were afloat.</p>
<p>Someone had cast them adrift. Was that
someone on deck at this moment or had he
merely cut the cable, removed the blocks and
allowed the wind to do the rest? This must be
determined at once.</p>
<p>Hastily dragging some rubbers on her benumbed
feet, she splashed her way to the door.
Having made sure that this was securely locked,
she went to each window and porthole, fastening
each as securely as possible. This done, she
fought her way to Lucile&rsquo;s berth and, steadying
herself with one hand, placed the other on Lucile&rsquo;s
brow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>An exclamation escaped her lips. The forehead
was burning hot. Lucile had a raging
fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had the coward who cut us loose,&rdquo; she
cried through clenched teeth, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />A MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>There are people who cannot sleep during a
storm. It sets their nerves a-tingle, sets wild
racing thoughts crowding through their minds
and leaves them sleeplessly alert. It is as if a
thousand wild witches rode on every mad rush
of the wind, their shrill voices screaming in each
blast, their fingers rattling at every windowpane
and their breath puffing at the flickering light.</p>
<p>Mark Pence could not sleep during that storm.
Rocking every schooner, yacht and yawl on its
cradle of trestlework, it went racing out over
the lake, carrying every movable object with it.
After many vain attempts to close his eyes, he
at last rose and drawing on his clothes, said
to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out and fight with it for a time. After
that I may be able to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! What a whooper!&rdquo; he exclaimed
as the wind, slamming the door after him, blew
him half-way to the beach. Grappling with the
wind, as one grapples a wrestling mate, he
stooped low, then shot forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like springing against a volley-ball net.&rdquo;
He shrieked the words in wild defiance of the
wind.</p>
<p>Then, steadily, step by step, he fought his way
toward the nearest schooner. Having gained the
lee of it he paused a moment for breath.</p>
<p>The storm came in gusts. Now in a blinding
fury of snow, it blotted out everything about
him. Now there was a lull. The wind appeared
to pause to regain its breath. At such times as
this his eyes penetrated the space before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look quite right over there,&rdquo; he
grumbled. &ldquo;Something the matter with the sky
line. Not enough boats, one would say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had regained his breath. For a moment
he debated the advisability of venturing further
into the storm. Finally he buttoned his coat
collar tighter as he muttered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go over and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he moved from his position of safety there
came another gust. More furious than any that
had gone before, it threatened to lift him from
the earth and hurl him into the lake. But, stooping
low, all but crawling, he made headway and,
just as the lull came, gripped the top rail of
the trestle on which the O Moo had rested.</p>
<p>Hardly had he seized it than his hand slipped
and he went sprawling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;Awful slippery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Removing one glove, he felt of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grease!&rdquo; he muttered in blank astonishment.
&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s greased that track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with the suspicion of treachery dawning
upon him, he glanced up at the spot where
the O Moo should have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The O Moo&rsquo;s gone!
And six hours ago, she was here. I&rsquo;d swear
it. Saw it with my own eyes. Light in the window.
Girls there. Now she&rsquo;s gone and the girls
with her. Gone in such a storm! What madness!&rdquo;
Again he thought of the greased track.
&ldquo;No! No! What treachery!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>From his pocket he drew a flashlight. He
meant to examine that track. It had been
heavily greased all the way down to the water.
That the iron wheels of the car on which the
O Moo had rested had passed down the track,
there could be no doubt. Mingled with the
grease there was much iron rust.</p>
<p>Drawing from his pocket a used envelope, he
scraped a quantity of the grease into it, then
replaced the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidence,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;Might not be
worth much; might mean a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind was roaring again. Clinging to the
trestle, he waited its passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Gone out to sea!
It&rsquo;s those Chinks. What beasts! I&rsquo;ll get them!
Go after them in just another minute. Then
I&rsquo;ll make them help me launch my schooner to
go in search of that O Moo. Three girls! Not
one of them knows how to start the engine.
Girl called Marian told me so. And in such a
storm! Got to make sure though! Got to get
all the evidence I can!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Again he fought his way against the wind
until he came to the point where the heavy
blocks had held in place the wheels of the truck
beneath the O Moo. These had been fastened
by strong cleats. Hard, silent work had been
required to loosen them. Throwing the light
upon the blocks, he examined them carefully.</p>
<p>On the side of one he discovered a peculiar
mark. The wood, flattened out under pressure
for a space of some four square inches, was
raised in the very center in two narrow lines,
each an inch long. These lines crossed one
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it home. More evidence, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having fought his way up to the place where
the cable had been fastened he examined the
loosened end without discovering anything peculiar
about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can do here,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Now
for the rescue. Got to have help. Old Timmie&rsquo;s
not much good&mdash;too old. Fishermen all
gone up the coast to fish through the ice. Chinks
all there are left. Make &rsquo;em help undo what
they&rsquo;ve done. If they won&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;ll fetch
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a lull in the storm he returned to his
schooner. There he deposited the &ldquo;evidence,&rdquo;
then throwing a small, cloth-strapped case over
his shoulder and thrusting a bottle into his
pocket he again ventured out into the storm.
This time he turned his face toward the scow
inhabited by the Orientals.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Hardly had Florence, standing by the side
of Lucile&rsquo;s berth, hurled out her fiery denunciation
of the wretch who had cast their yacht
afloat than the O Moo gave a sudden lurch
which threw her to the floor.</p>
<p>Pandemonium broke loose. There came a
crash of glass from the laboratory. Out of
the darkness a bulk loomed at her. As she attempted
to rise the thing appearing to spring at
her, knocked her down. Then some other thing
buried her deep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>The thing that had struck her was a heavy
chair. She was buried beneath the blanket and
mattress from her own berth.</p>
<p>As she attempted to extricate herself it
seemed that the entire contents of the cabin
played leapfrog over her head. Careening like
a deserted airship the O Moo appeared to plunge
prow first down an endless abyss, only to climb
laboriously up on the other side.</p>
<p>This did not last for long. There was no
engine going, no driving power. Suddenly she
slipped into the trough of a huge wave and wallowed
there helplessly, while tons of rushing
water swept across her deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engine!&rdquo; gasped Florence. &ldquo;It should
be started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Struggling to free herself, she thought of
Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May have been thrown from her berth,&rdquo;
she groaned.</p>
<p>Groping about she found Lucile&rsquo;s berth, clung
there while the yacht gave a wild, circling lurch,
then felt for her sick companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Clinging to the rail of her berth, Lucile lay
there silently sobbing.</p>
<p>Securing two blankets, Florence twisted them
into ropes, then bound them across Lucile, one
at her knees, the other at her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll hold you,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>Starting across the cabin to the electric
switch, she was caught again and thrown off
her feet. She collided with something. That
something put out two arms which encircled
her. The two of them fell to the floor, then
rolled half the length of it.</p>
<p>Having regained her breath, Florence put out
a hand. She touched a garment. She knew by
the feel of it that it was Marian. &ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re still here&mdash;and alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of all this catastrophe, Marian
began to giggle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too absurd!&rdquo; she exploded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve traveled on the Arctic and Pacific,
real oceans, and come here and have a
mere lake kick up such a rumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Marian,&rdquo; Florence expostulated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
serious. These winter lake storms are terrible.
The ship may go to the bottom any moment.
It wasn&rsquo;t built for this. And there may be ice,
too. One crack from ice and she&rsquo;d burst like an
eggshell. C&rsquo;mon, we&rsquo;ve got to get lights. Gotta
start the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragging Marian to her feet, she made her
way along the wall to the light switch.</p>
<p>There came a sudden flood of light which
brought out in bold relief the havoc wrought
by the storm. Tables, chairs, lounge, writing
paper, notebooks, shoes, garments of all sorts,
were piled in a heap forward. The heavy carpet
was soggy with water.</p>
<p>One glance revealed that. The next instant
the lights flickered and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to find a candle,&rdquo; said Florence soberly.
&ldquo;Water on the battery wires. Caused a
short circuit. We can&rsquo;t hope to use electricity.
Ought to get engine started some way. Got to
get a candle. You just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; screamed Marian, as she leaped
toward a berth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>The O Moo had suddenly shot her prow high
in air. The entire contents of the cabin came
avalanching down upon them.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Having made his way, in the midst of the
storm, to the door of the scow on the dry dock
occupied by the Orientals, Mark Pence paused
to arrange the cloth strap carefully over his
shoulder and to feel in his pocket. Then he
beat loudly upon the door.</p>
<p>As he had expected, he received no answer.</p>
<p>Without further formalities he put his knees
to the door and gave it a shove. The flimsy lock
broke so suddenly that he was thrown forward.
Losing his balance, he plunged headforemost
down a short flight of stairs.</p>
<p>With a low, whispered exclamation he sprang
to his feet. Putting his ear to the wall, he
listened. There were sounds, low grunts, slight
shuffling of feet. It was uncanny. A cold
perspiration stood out on his brow. &ldquo;Danger
here,&rdquo; he whispered as he once more adjusted
the cloth strap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The corridor in which he was standing was
dark, but a stream of blue light poured out
from beneath a door to his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! You! Come out of there!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>Instantly bedlam followed. Doors were flung
open. A glaring blue light flooded all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O we-ee-ee! O wee-ee-ee,&rdquo; came from every
side.</p>
<p>A knife flashed before him. Springing back,
he tripped over something, then suddenly
plunged downward. He had fallen down the
circular stairway. After a wild dizzy whirl, he
reached bottom with a bump.</p>
<p>Immediately he was on his feet. His hand
gripped the bottle. It was dark down here; dark
as a dungeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get out of here,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Whew! What a lot of them! Twenty or
thirty! No use hoping for help from them.
Fool for thinking I could. Got to get out and
find help somewhere else&mdash;and get out quick.
Be coming down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Drawing something from the case slung
across his shoulder, he pulled it down over his
face. It was a gas mask, his old war mask, recharged.</p>
<p>Gripping the bottle in his pocket, a bottle of
Lucile&rsquo;s quick action gas, he began to climb the
stairs.</p>
<p>He had made two-thirds of the distance when,
sensing someone close to him, he threw his
flashlight open.</p>
<p>Right before him, grinning fiendishly, a knife
between his teeth, was a giant Oriental. Mark
did not wait for the attack he knew was coming.
He drew back his arm. When it swung forward
his hand held the bottle of gas&mdash;he sent
it crashing against the iron post.</p>
<p>The Oriental sprang back up the stairs. Following
him closely, Mark made a dash for the
door. All about him sounded wild exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas getting in its work,&rdquo; he muttered, darting
among the writhing bodies. He reached the
foot of the short stairs which led to the outer
door. Now his hand was on the knob. And
now the door flew open. He was free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>But what was this? Just as he made a dash
for it, the gruff voice of someone very near him
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come. Nail &rsquo;em. There&rsquo;s the
first one. Got a mask on. Get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all he heard, for a stunning blow
crashed on his head; he staggered, fell, then all
was dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />THE O MOO RIDES THE STORM</h2>
<p>Florence and Marian lay clinging to the bare
springs of a berth. They had made that point
of safety before the avalanche of furniture,
books and bric-a-brac had reached their end of
the cabin. They were enduring discomforts
beyond description. The yacht was now pitching
from side to side in an alarming fashion.
The wires of the spring on which they rested
cut their tender flesh. Their scant clothing was
saturated with cold water. The cabin had
grown cold. Since the burning of the electric
fuses, there was no heat. They were chilled
to the bone, yet they dared not move. The
heavy furniture, pitching about as it did, was a
deadly menace. Here, above it all, they were
safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>As Florence lay there, benumbed with cold,
suffering agonies of suspense, listening to the
thud and smash of furniture, the rush and
crush of waves that washed the deck, awaiting
the crash which was to be the final one, only
one question occupied her mind: How and when
would the final moment come? She dared not
hope that the O Moo would ride such a storm
safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the O Moo,&rdquo; she asked herself,
&ldquo;turn turtle in the trough of a wave and, floating,
mast down, would she hold them there to
drown like rats in a cage? Or would some giant
wave stave her in to sink to the bottom like a
water-soaked log?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An answer was postponed. The O Moo rode
bravely on. They were in the worst of it; she
was sure of that. &ldquo;Ought to get the engine
started,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Then we could cut
the waves; ride them, not wallow along in a
trough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She half rose to attempt to reach the engine
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; she groaned; &ldquo;no light. If we
fool around with gasoline and a candle we&rsquo;ll
blow the whole thing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as she thought this, she became conscious
of a dim light. What could it be? She
sat up quickly, then she uttered a hoarse laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First gray streak of dawn,&rdquo; she muttered.
Then she thought of Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; she said to Marian.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to get to Lucile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the aid of the feeble light she saw her
opportunity to vault over a careening chair and
to make a dash for it. A second later she was
at Lucile&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucile!&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Lucile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes were closed. A sudden fear
seized Florence and her heart stood still a beat.
Was Lucile asleep, unconscious, or&mdash;or was
she dead?</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Over in the darkness and storm by the old
scow, Mark Pence was slowly regaining consciousness.
At first he imagined that a tiny
train of cars was running about on the top of
his head. This illusion vanished. He felt
something hard in his mouth&mdash;tried to think
what it was. He had been gagged! That was
his first thought. No, that wasn&rsquo;t it. He was
breathing through the thing. The mouthpiece
to his mask! That was it. He had kept it in
his mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>He was fully conscious now but did not attempt
to sit up. Footsteps were approaching.
He heard a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got away,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but one. Drunk, that&rsquo;s what they was.
You can&rsquo;t hardly shoot drunk men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first voice retorted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, we got one; the one with
the mask. Didn&rsquo;t hit him hard. He ought to
be coming round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark tried to discover the meaning of all this.
The place had been raided. The Orientals had
escaped. They had swarmed out yelling like
mad men probably. The quick action gas would
make them act as if under the influence of
liquor. Probably they had tumbled the raiders
over. But who were these raiders?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>He did not have long to wait for the answer.
A rough hand dragged the mask from his face.
He looked up into the frank blue eyes of a
burly policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; round. Sit up. Why, you&rsquo;re
no Oriental! You&rsquo;re a white kid. What you
doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark sat up and told them what he had been
doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That quick action gas now,&rdquo; laughed one of
the men, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be bad stuff for the police
force now and again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Mark made an effort to rise. He
had thought of the plight of his friends on the
O Moo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;ll help me launch my schooner!&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you see those girls in the O Moo don&rsquo;t
know how to start their engine. Somebody&rsquo;s
got to bring them in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your schooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Elsie C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That turtle shell? You&rsquo;d be committin&rsquo; suicide
to go in her. You come along with us.
We&rsquo;re holdin&rsquo; you as a material witness and&mdash;and
to prevent you from committing suicide by
trying the lake in that shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Mark obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t something be done?&rdquo; he demanded
desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before morning. Not much then,
probably. How&rsquo;d you find a yacht blowin&rsquo;
round loose in this whirlin&rsquo; bag of snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>There is a bottom to every depth, a state of
darkness which cannot be exceeded, a limit even
to despair. As Florence looked upon Lucile&rsquo;s
closed eyes she reached the bottom; experienced
the utter darkness; found the limit of despair.</p>
<p>And then a strangely joyous thing happened.</p>
<p>Lucile&rsquo;s eyes opened. She smiled faintly.
Strange to say, in the midst of this tumult, she
had merely fallen asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Florence took a new and firmer grip on hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how do you feel?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am better,&rdquo; Lucile whispered.
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said Florence quickly.
&ldquo;Day is breaking. The storm will go down as
the sun rises. They&rsquo;ll be after us in a tug. In
a few hours we&rsquo;ll be back on the dock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said all this very quickly, not knowing
how much of it she believed herself, but feeling
quite sure that Lucile ought to believe it. Just
then a chair, pitching across the floor, caught
her behind the knees and sent her sprawling.</p>
<p>The very shock of this set her blood tingling.
&ldquo;Believe we could do something about the
furniture now it&rsquo;s getting light,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marian,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;come on down and
let&rsquo;s see what we can do to save things. We&rsquo;re
ruined as it is. No more university for us. It
will take all the money we have to put this cabin
back into condition. But we might as well save
what we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>A table came lurching at her. She caught it
as if it were a piece of gymnasium equipment.
Then rescuing a water-soaked sheet from the
floor she tied the table to a hand-rail.</p>
<p>Marian joined her in pursuit of the cabin
furnishings. It really grew into quite a game.
If a chair came at them too viciously they were
obliged to vault over it and bring up an attack
from the rear. If a whole platoon of tables and
chairs leaped at them in the same second, they
took to the cots.</p>
<p>Little by little order was restored. When a
survey had been made it was found that one
table was broken to splinters, two chairs had
broken legs and numerous books and pictures
had been utterly ruined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been worse,&rdquo; said Florence
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Marian, &ldquo;We might have gone
to the bottom. I do believe the storm is letting
up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>She attempted to look out of a porthole. Daylight
had come. Snow had ceased falling but a
heavy fog was driving over the turbulent
waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine chance of anyone finding us,&rdquo; Marian
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Florence warned as she shook a finger
at Lucile&rsquo;s berth, then aloud: &ldquo;Boo! but I&rsquo;m
cold. Where are our clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian pointed mournfully at a mass of
soggy rags in the corner. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she exclaimed
suddenly, &ldquo;no, not all. We put our evening
skirts and middies and slippers in the hammock
of our berths. And,&rdquo; she shouted joyously,
&ldquo;they are there still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some desperate struggles at keeping
their balance and dressing at the same time,
they found themselves warmly clad and immediately
matters took on a different aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; ventured Florence, &ldquo;that we
might get the generator going. There&rsquo;s just one
place where water would cause a short circuit
and that can be dried out by a candle. Then we
can put in a new fuse and that little old friend
of ours will be chug-chugging as well as ever.
Not that I feel any need of heat,&rdquo; she mocked
with a shrug and shiver, &ldquo;but you know the
supplying of warmth to our homes has become a
social custom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Having taken a candle from a drawer she
lighted it, lifted a trap door and descended to
the generator. She was relieved to note that
the O Moo had shipped very little water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dandy staunch little craft,&rdquo; she
sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to have abused her so. I&rsquo;d
like to have a hand on the person who turned
her loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a quarter of an hour she worked patiently
on the generator; then there came a sudden pop-pop-pop
and the hardy little machine was doing
its work once more.</p>
<p>At once a drowsy warmth began to creep
over the cabin.</p>
<p>The storm was really beginning to abate.
Waves no longer washed the deck. The O Moo
rose high, to fall low again as great, sweeping
swells raced across the surface of the lake, but
she did not pitch and toss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Marian brought the electric range up from
its hiding. After wiping it dry, she made toast
and tea. The first she gave to Lucile. Then,
after seeing her eyes close once more in sleep,
she shared a scant breakfast with Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are looking better, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
she sighed. &ldquo;I am really beginning to think
we&rsquo;ll get out of this alive. Won&rsquo;t that be wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those questions,&rdquo; smiled Florence, &ldquo;must be
answered one at a time, but I have faith that
they will both be answered and that we&rsquo;ll be
back in the dear old city for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two weeks off. Next week is final exams.
We&rsquo;ve just got to be back for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case let&rsquo;s have a look at the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later the two girls, dressed in
greasy overalls, their hair done in knots over
their heads, their hands black with oil, might
have been seen engaged in the futile attempt to
unravel the mysteries of the small gasoline engine,
which, in other days, had been used to
propel the O Moo when the wind failed to fill
her sails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might be able to sail her home,&rdquo; suggested
Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<p>Risking a look out on deck, she opened a door.
Her eyes swept the space before her. Her lips
uttered a low exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! Mast, canvas, everything. We can&rsquo;t
sail home, that&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Mark Pence, after his strange adventures at
the old scow, was marched off to the police
station, where he was allowed to doze beside the
radiator until morning.</p>
<p>Soon after daybreak he was motioned to a
desk, where a sergeant questioned him closely
regarding his knowledge of the events of the
night and of the Orientals who lived in the old
scow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>He was able to tell little enough and to explain
next to nothing. When he had told of the disappearance
of the O Moo, of the grease on the
tracks, of the sample he had saved and of the
block of wood with the cross embossed upon it,
the officer proposed that they should together
make a trip to the beach and go over the
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these friends of mine? These girls in
the O Moo?&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That!&rdquo; exclaimed the sergeant. &ldquo;What
could you do? That was reported to the life-saving
station hours ago. Best thing you can
do is to help us track down the rascals who
played such an inhuman trick on your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have been their motive?&rdquo; demanded
Mark suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;is a mystery which
must be cleared up. We think we know. But
you never can tell. Are you ready? We&rsquo;ll have
a cup of coffee before we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later Mark found himself standing
once more before the old scow. In the broad
light of day it had lost much of its air of mystery.
The door had been left open and had been
blown half full of snow. Having climbed over
this pile of snow, they entered the hallway and
descended the narrow, circular stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>A hasty search told them that the place was
deserted. A careful examination revealed the
fact that the bottom of the scow had been cut
away; that a cellar had been dug beneath it, then
walled up with cement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular underground den,&rdquo; the officer exclaimed.
&ldquo;Must have been a swarm of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty or thirty, I guess,&rdquo; said Mark
absent-mindedly. He had picked up a clumsily
hand-forged ax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll take that along,&rdquo; he said presently.</p>
<p>In another room he found a large iron pot
one-third full of a peculiar grease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Come on
over to my schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to his schooner. A comparison of
his sample of grease with that in the iron pot
left no doubt as to who had greased the track
over which the O Moo had glided to the water.
The ax he had brought from the scow had a
cross on one side of it, cut no doubt with a
chisel when the steel was still hot. The cross
embossed on the wood exactly fitted in the cross
on the side of the ax.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They drove the ax in to pull the nails,&rdquo;
Mark explained. &ldquo;Then when the cleats didn&rsquo;t
give way, they used something to pry the ax
loose. That&rsquo;s how the ax came to leave its
mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have thought the noise would have
wakened your friends,&rdquo; said the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a wild storm. Couldn&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sergeant, yawning as he
rose, &ldquo;that fixes something definitely on them.
That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been trying to do for some
time. Next thing is to catch them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did they do it?&rdquo; insisted Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the sergeant, &ldquo;since you&rsquo;ve
helped us and I know you won&rsquo;t go blabbing, I&rsquo;ll
tell you what we think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long story, a story so absorbingly
mysterious that Mark started when he looked
at the clock and saw that a whole hour had
been consumed in the telling of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; smiled the officer as he rose
to go. &ldquo;Tell your lady friends on this O Moo
if you like but not anybody else. They&rsquo;ve got a
right to know, I guess, and they&rsquo;ll keep quiet
about it until the thing&rsquo;s settled for good and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />LAND AT LAST</h2>
<p>Florence stood upon the deck. The storm
had swept it clean. She was clinging to a hand
rail at the side of the cabin. The water was
still rolling about in great sweeping swells. Fog
hung low over all. Strain her eyes as she might,
she could see but a hundred yards. The boat,
she discovered, had no horn or siren attached
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had one,&rdquo; she told Marian, &ldquo;we
could keep it going. Then, if anyone is searching
for us, he would be able to locate us by the
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood there trying to imagine where they
were, and what was to be the next scene in their
little drama. All efforts to start the engine had
been futile. There are a thousand types of
gasoline engines. Marian had at one time managed
a small motor on Lucile&rsquo;s boat but that one
had been of quite a different type.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t any use,&rdquo; Marian had sighed at last.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get it going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So there Florence stood thinking. Marian
was in the cabin preparing some hot soup for
Lucile. Lucile&rsquo;s condition was much improved.
She was sitting up in her berth. That much was
good. But where were they and whither were
they bound?</p>
<p>They had gone over their supplies and had
found in all about eight pounds of flour and part
of a tin of baking powder, three pounds of
sugar, a half pound of coffee and a quarter
pound of tea, two tins of sardines, a few dried
prunes and peaches, two glasses of preserves
and a few other odds and ends. Beside these
there were still twelve cans of the &ldquo;unlabeled
and unknown&rdquo; vegetables and fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; Marian had smiled, &ldquo;that they are
all corn. One can live much longer on corn
than on pineapple.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t live long on that supply,&rdquo;
Florence had said soberly. &ldquo;Something has
just got to happen. And,&rdquo; she had added,
&ldquo;perhaps it won&rsquo;t. If it were summer, things
would be different, for at that time of the year
the lake is dotted with vessels. But now they
are all holed up or in dry dock. Only now and
then one ventures out. We may have been
blown out a long way from shore too; probably
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of all this now. At the
same time her eyes were squinting, half closed.
She was trying to pierce the fog.</p>
<p>Suddenly she started. Had she seen something
off to the left? A whitish bulk rising out
of the fog?</p>
<p>She could not be sure. Well aware that one&rsquo;s
eyes play tricks on him when out at sea, she
looked away, then turned her gaze once more to
the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Never was there at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she struck that listless, drooping pose
which gave her whole body rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;there it is again.
They have come for us. They have found us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to scream, to tell the other girls
that help was near, but &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she decided,
&ldquo;not too soon. It might not be. If it is,
they&rsquo;ll see us. The O Moo stands well out of
the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To still her wildly beating heart, she allowed
her gaze to wander off to the right.</p>
<p>Instantly she blinked her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she exclaimed, then, &ldquo;Yes it
is&mdash;it is! Another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning once more to the left, she found
still another surprise. Two of them off there.</p>
<p>Fear began to assail her. Her forehead grew
cold. Her hands trembled. Was it, after all,
a false hope?</p>
<p>She had but a moment to wait. Then she
knew. The fog had lifted slightly. She could
see farther, could tell what was closing down
upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>The shock was too much for her. She sank
limply to the deck. It was as if she had been
wandering in a fog on a rocky hillside searching
for sheep, had thought she saw them coming
out of the fog, only to discover that the creatures
she saw were prowling wolves. The white
bulks on the surface of the water were not
boats searching for them but cakes of ice. And
these, there could be no doubt about it, were
fast closing in upon the O Moo. With the
water still heaving, this meant danger&mdash;might
indeed mean the destruction of their craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought,&rdquo; she struggled to her feet, &ldquo;I
ought to tell the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet she did not tell them. What was the
use? she reasoned. There was nothing to do
but wait, and that she could do very well alone.</p>
<p>There is something awe-inspiring about the
gathering of great bodies of ice which have
been scattered by a storm. They come together
as if each had a motor, an engineer and a
pilot on board. And yet their coming is in absolute
silence. If one cake chances to touch another,
the contact is so slight that there is no
sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>And so they assemble. Coming from all
points of the compass, they reunite as a great
fleet might after a mighty and victorious battle.</p>
<p>The O Moo chanced to be in the very midst
of this particular gathering. As Florence
watched she was thrilled and fascinated. Now
the surface was a field of blue cloth with a
white patch here and there. Now the white
covered half, now two-thirds, now three-fourths
of the field. And now a cake brushed the hull
of the yacht ever so gently.</p>
<p>Suddenly she realized that a strange thing
had happened. The water which had been
rolling had ceased to roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ice did that,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Perhaps
it&rsquo;s not dangerous after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched until the cloth of blue had been
almost completely changed to one of white, then
burst into the cabin.</p>
<p>To her unbounded surprise, she found her
companions sitting on Lucile&rsquo;s berth with wrapt
attention staring out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful!&rdquo; whispered Lucile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought it would be terribly dangerous,&rdquo;
said Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Marian. &ldquo;It may be if
we come to shore and the wind crowds the ice,
but even then we&rsquo;ll be safe enough. We can
escape over the ice to shore. Only,&rdquo; she added
thoughtfully, &ldquo;in that case the O Moo will be
crushed. And that would be too sad after she
has carried us through the storm so bravely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence still looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; smiled Marian, &ldquo;Lucile and I
have been in the ice-packs on the Arctic, so
we know. Don&rsquo;t we, old dear?&rdquo; She patted
Lucile on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh&mdash;huh,&rdquo; smiled Lucile as she settled
back on her pillow.</p>
<p>Ice, as Marian had said, is quite a safe convoy
of the sea until some shore is reached.</p>
<p>For twenty-four hours they drifted in the
midst of the floe. Now a sea gull came soaring
and screaming about the yacht. And now he
went skimming away, leaving them to the vast
silence of the conquered waters. Fog hung
low over the water and the ice. No long-drawn
hoot of a fog horn, no shrill siren&rsquo;s scream
greeted their anxious ears. A great silence
hung over all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Then Florence, who was standing on deck,
noticed that, almost inperceptibly, the fog was
lifting. She had been thinking of the last
twenty-four hours. Lucile, who was much
better, had left her berth and was sitting on
one of the upholstered chairs. Marian was
trying for the hundredth time to start the engine.</p>
<p>As Florence thought this through, she found
herself at the same time wondering what the
lifting of the fog would mean to them. Had
they, after all, drifted only a short distance
from the city? Would they be able, once the
fog had cleared, to distinguish the jagged shore
which the city&rsquo;s sky line cut out of the blue?
Would there be some boat nearer than they had
dreamed? Or had they really drifted a long
way? Would they look upon a shoreless expanse
of water or would the irregular tree-line
of some unknown shore greet them?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>The fog was slow in passing. She was
eager for the unveiling of this mystery. Impatiently
she paced the deck.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, she paused, shaded her eyes,
and looked directly before her. Was there
some, low, dark bulk appearing off there before
the very course the ice was taking?</p>
<p>For a long time she could not be sure. Then
with a startled exclamation she leaped to the
door of the cabin crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls! Marian! Lucile! Look! Land!
Land ahead of the ice-floe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian came racing out on deck, followed
more slowly by Lucile. For a moment they all
stood there looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s land all right,&rdquo; said Marian at last,
&ldquo;but not much land. A little sandy island with
a great many small evergreen trees growing on
it, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or perhaps a point,&rdquo; suggested Lucile
hopefully. &ldquo;You see, if it&rsquo;s a point we can
go back just a little way and find people, people
with plenty of food and&mdash;and everything.&rdquo;
Lucile had had quite enough of this adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better not to hope for too much,&rdquo; smiled
Marian, &ldquo;&lsquo;Hope for the best, be prepared for
the worst,&rsquo; is my motto. And the worst!&rdquo;
she exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;is that the ice will
begin to buckle and pile when it touches that
shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it will crush the O Moo,&rdquo; said Florence
with a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, unless,&rdquo; Marian was studying the situation
carefully, &ldquo;unless we can escape it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she said no more. Then suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe we could. There are pike-poles
in the cabin. Florence, bring them, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence came back presently with two stout
poles some twelve feet long. These were armed
with stout iron hooks and points at one end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Marian rapidly, &ldquo;we
are much nearer the fore edge of the floe than
to either side or to the back, and up there some
forty feet there is a narrow channel reaching
almost through to the edge. All that is necessary
is that we crowd the ice to right and left
a bit until we reach that channel, then draw the
O Moo through it. If we reach the sandy shore
before the floe does, the worst that can happen
is that the O Moo will be driven aground but
not crushed at all, and the best that can happen
is that we will find some sort of little harbor
where the yacht will be safe until the wind
shifts and the ice goes back out to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can we move that ice?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s face
showed her incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier than it looks. Come on,&rdquo; ordered
Marian briskly. Throwing the rope ladder
over the side, she sprang down it to leap out
upon a broad ice pan.</p>
<p>Florence shuddered as she followed. This
was all new to her.</p>
<p>Marian had said that it was easy, but they
did not find it so. True, they did move the O
Moo forward. Inch by inch, foot by foot,
fathom by fathom she glided forward. But this
was accomplished only at the cost of blistered
hands, aching muscles and breaking backs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>All this time the ice-floe was moving slowly
but surely forward. Now it was a hundred
fathoms from the shore, now fifty, now thirty.
And now&mdash;</p>
<p>But just at this moment the yacht moved
out into the open water before the floe. At
the same time Marian caught sight of a narrow
stream which cut down through the sandy beach
some fifty yards from the point where they had
broken through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we can make that channel,&rdquo; she
panted. &ldquo;If the water&rsquo;s deep enough all the
way to it, we can. Or if the floe doesn&rsquo;t come
too fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, who thought she had expended
every ounce of energy in her body, took three
long breaths, then, having hooked her pole to
the prow of the O Moo, began to pull. Soon
Marian joined her on the pole and together the
girls struggled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>By uniting their energies they were able to
drag the reluctant O Moo length by length
toward the goal.</p>
<p>Once Florence, having entrusted her weight
to a rotten bit of ice, plunged into the chilling
waters. But by Marian&rsquo;s aid she climbed upon
a safer cake and, shaking the water from her,
resumed her titanic labors. Twice the hull of
the O Moo touched bottom. Each time they
were able to drag her free.</p>
<p>At last with a long-drawn sigh they threw
their united strength into a shove which sent
her, prow first, up the still waters at the mouth
of the stream.</p>
<p>There remained for them but one means of
reaching shore&mdash;to swim.</p>
<p>With a little &ldquo;Oo-oo!&rdquo; Marian plunged in.
She was followed closely by Florence.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later they were in the cabin
of the O Moo and rough linen towels were
bringing the warm, ruddy glow of life back
to their half-frozen limbs. The O Moo was
lying close to the bank where an overhanging
tree gave them a safe mooring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>As Florence at last, after having drawn
on a garment of soft clingy material and having
thrown a warm dressing gown over this, sank
into a chair, she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks be! We are here. But, after all,
where is &lsquo;here&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />&ldquo;A PHANTOM WIRELESS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was night, dark, cloudy, moonless night.
Florence could scarcely see enough of the sandy
beach to tell where she was going. She had,
however, been over that same ground in the
daytime, so she knew it pretty well. Besides,
she wasn&rsquo;t going any place; just walking back
and forth, up and down a long, narrow stretch
of hard-packed and frozen sand.</p>
<p>She was thinking. Walking in the darkness
helped her to think. When there is nothing to
hear, nothing to see and nothing to feel, and
when the movement of one&rsquo;s feet keeps the blood
moving, then one can do the best thinking. Anyway
that was the way this big, healthy, hopeful
college girl thought about it. So she had wrapped
herself in a heavy cape and had come out
to think.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>They had been ice-locked on the island for
thirty-six hours. The ice had crowded on shore
for a time. It had piled high in places. Now
the wind had gone down and it was growing
colder. It seemed probable that the ice would
freeze into one solid mass, in which case they
would be locked in for who knows how long.</p>
<p>The water in their little natural harbor had
taken on something of a crust. It was possible
that the boat would be frozen into the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that it matters,&rdquo; she told herself rather
gloomily. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t start the engine and as
long as we can&rsquo;t it is impossible for us to leave
the island; only thing we can do is wait until
someone discovers our plight or we are able
to hail a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>They were on an island; they had made sure
of that first thing. She and Marian had gone
completely around it. It wasn&rsquo;t much of an
island either. Just a wreath of sand thrown
up from the bottom of the lake, it could scarcely
be more than three miles long by a half mile
wide. The stream they had entered, running
almost from end to end of it, drained the whole
of it. The highest point was at the north.
This point was a sand dune some forty feet
high. Their boat was moored at the south end.
The entire island, except along the beach, was
covered with a scrub growth of pine and fir
trees. As far as they could tell, not a single
person had ever lived on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange,&rdquo; Marian had said when
they had made the rounds of it. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
seem possible that there could be such an island
on the lake without summer cottages on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Florence had answered.
&ldquo;What an ideal spot! Wonderful beaches on
every side. Fishing too, I guess. And far
enough from land to enjoy a cool breeze on
the hottest day of summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though they had constantly strained their
eyes in an endeavor to discover other land in
the distance, they had not succeeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably belongs to someone who will not
lease it,&rdquo; said Florence at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>So here she was trying to think things
through. There was danger of a real catastrophe.
The food in their pantry could not
possibly last over ten days. Then what? As
far as she knew, there was not a thing to be
eaten on the island. It was possible that fish
could be caught beneath the lake ice or in their
stream. She meant to try that in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a plight to put one in!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Who could have done it and why
did they do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This question set her mind running over the
mysterious incidents which, she could not but
believe, had led up to this present moment.</p>
<p>There had been Lucile&rsquo;s seeing of the blue
face in the old Mission, her own affair with
the stranger in the museum; the blue candlestick;
the visit to Mr. Cole in the new museum;
Lucile&rsquo;s frightful adventure on the lake ice;
the incident of the two men with the sled on
the ice of the lagoon and the single man sitting
on the ice; then the spot of blue ice discovered
next day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blue ice!&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly, stopping
still in her tracks. &ldquo;Blue! Blue ice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence frowned, as she considered it.</p>
<p>A new theory had come to her regarding that
spot of blue ice on the lagoon, a theory which
made her wish more than ever to get away
from this island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, well,&rdquo; she whispered at last, &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll
probably be a thaw before we get back or those
men will come back and tear it up. But if
there isn&rsquo;t, if they don&rsquo;t then&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll see
what we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still puzzling over these problems
when a strange noise, leaping seemingly out
of nowhere, smote her ear.</p>
<p>It was such a rumble and roar as she had
heard but once before in all her life. That
sound had come to her over a telephone wire
as she pressed her ear to the receiver during
a thunderstorm. But here there was neither
wire nor receiver and the very thought of a
thunderstorm on such a night was ridiculous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>At first she was inclined to believe it to be
the sound of some disturbance on the lake,
a sudden rush of wind or a tidal wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is little wind and the sea is
calm,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>She was in the midst of these perplexities
when the sound broke into a series of sput-sput-sputs.
Her heart stood still for a second,
then raced on as her lips framed the word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wireless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ridiculous was the thought that the word
died on her lips. There was no wireless outfit
on the yacht; could be none on the island, for
had they not made the entire round? Had
they not found it entirely uninhabited? Whence,
then, came this strange clash of man-made
lightning? The girl could find no answer to
her own unspoken questions.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s thought she was inclined
to believe that she was hearing the sounds created
by some unknown electrical phenomena.
Men were constantly discovering new things
about electricity. Perhaps, all unknown to
them, such isolated points as this automatically
served as relay stations to pass along wireless
messages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Not entirely satisfied with this theory, she
left the beach and, feeling her way carefully
among the small evergreens, came at last to the
base of a fir tree which capped the ridge. This
tree, apparently of an earlier growth, towered
half its height above its fellows.</p>
<p>Reaching up to the first branch she began to
ascend. She climbed two-thirds of the way to
the top with great ease. There she paused.</p>
<p>The sound had ceased. Only the faint wash-wash
of wavelets on ice and shore, mingled
with the mournful sighing of the pines, disturbed
the silence of the night.</p>
<p>For some time she stood there clinging to the
branches. Here she caught the full sweep of the
lake breeze. She grew cold; began to shiver;
called herself a fool; decided to climb down
again, and was preparing to do so, when there
came again that rumbling roar, followed as before
by the clack-clack-clack, sput-sput.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; she murmured as she braced
herself once more and attempted to pierce the
darkness.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, the sound ceased. Strain her
ears as she might she caught no further sound.
She peered into the gloom, trying to descry the
wires of an aerial against the sky-line, but her
search was vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fairly spooky!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;A
phantom wireless station on a deserted island!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes longer she clung there motionless.
Then, feeling that she must turn into a
lump of ice if she lingered longer, she began to
climb down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back here in the morning and have
a look,&rdquo; she promised herself. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t tell the
girls; they&rsquo;ve troubles enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made her way back to the yacht and was
soon in her berth fast asleep.</p>
<p>It was with considerable amusement that she
retraced her steps next morning. There could
not, she told herself, be a wireless station of any
kind on that island. A wireless station called
for a home for the operators and there was no
such home. She and Marian had made sure
of that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But then what was it?&rdquo; she asked herself,
&ldquo;What could it have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She climbed the tree, this time up to its very
top, then, turning, shaded her eyes to gaze
away the length of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Nothing.
Just nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. There could be no wireless
tower. If there had been she could have seen
it. What was more, there certainly was no
house on the island. Had there been, she could
not have failed to detect its roof from her
point of vantage.</p>
<p>There was no house and no wireless station,
yet, as she looked her lips parted in an exclamation
of surprise.</p>
<p>She was witnessing strange things. Toward
the other end of the island something was
moving in and out among the drifting ice-cakes.
This, she made out presently, by the
flash of a paddle, was some sort of a boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And it is,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;No&mdash;no it
can&rsquo;t be! Yes, it is, it&rsquo;s an Eskimo kiak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once she thought of the Negontisks.
Could it be possible that they had stumbled upon
a secret home of some of these people?</p>
<p>As if in answer to her question, the strange
manipulator of this queer craft drew the kiak
on shore, then, skipping hurriedly along the
beach and up a sandy ridge, suddenly put two
hands on something and the next instant dropped
straight down and out of sight.</p>
<p>Florence caught her breath sharply. She
clutched the fir boughs in the fear that she
would fall.</p>
<p>Then, realizing that she might be plainly seen
if anyone chanced to look her way, she began
hastily to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might come out of his igloo and see
me,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>That the thing the person had entered was
an igloo she had no reason to doubt. Igloos go
with kiaks and are built beneath the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;the other girls
will know a great deal more about those things
than I do. I must tell them at once. We will
hold a council of war.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />THE ISLAND&rsquo;S SECRET</h2>
<p>Twenty-four hours after Florence&rsquo;s mysterious
discovery, the cabin of the O Moo was
pervaded by a quiet and studious atmosphere.
Lucile, who was quite herself again, was mastering
the contents of a book devoted to the study
of the technique of short story writing. Florence
was delving into the mysteries of the
working of the human mind. Marian was
doing a still life study in charcoal.</p>
<p>One might conclude that by some hosts of
good fairies the yacht had been spirited back
to its place on the dry dock. This was not,
however, the case. The O Moo was still standing
in the little stream on the sandy island.
Its position had been altered a trifle. It had
been poled out into midstream and there anchored.
This precaution the girls had felt was
necessary. In case the Negontisks attempted
to board the yacht it would give those on board
a slight advantage. It is difficult to board a
yacht from kiaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>That the strange persons who lived in holes
beneath the sand dunes were these wild natives
they did not doubt. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; Marian had reasoned,
&ldquo;who else in all the wide world would
live in such a manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; Florence had argued, &ldquo;how did
they ever get to the shores of Lake Michigan
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question could not be answered. The
fact remained that there were people living
beneath the ground on this island and that the
girls were afraid of them, so much afraid that
they were not willing, voluntarily, to expose
themselves to view.</p>
<p>This was why they were remaining aboard
the O Moo and studying rather than attempting
to catch fish. &ldquo;Might as well make the best of
our time,&rdquo; Florence had reasoned. To this the
others had agreed but when she went on to
say that she somehow felt that they would be
back at the university for final exams, they
shook their heads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>The food supply was growing lower with
every meal. Six cans of the unknown fruits and
vegetables had been opened and with all the
perversity of unknown quantities had turned
out to be fruit, pleasing but not nourishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some comfort in knowing that there
are other people on the island, at that,&rdquo; Lucile
had argued. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve probably got a supply
of food and, rather than starve, we can cast
ourselves upon their mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of them do you suppose there
are?&rdquo; Marian suddenly looked up from her
book to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only saw one,&rdquo; answered Florence, &ldquo;but
then of course there are others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange we didn&rsquo;t see any tracks when we
went the rounds of the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snowed the night before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But people usually have things outside their
igloos; sleds, boats and hunting gear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not when they&rsquo;re in hiding. There might
be fifty or a hundred of them. Nothing about
an igloo shows unless you chance to walk
right up to the entrance or the skylight. And
we didn&rsquo;t. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off abruptly as Lucile whispered.
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had hardly asked the question when the
sound came again&mdash;a loud trill. It was followed
this time by a musical:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who-hoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard a native make a sound like
that,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile, springing to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throwing caution to the wind the three of
them rushed for the door.</p>
<p>On reaching the deck, they saw, standing on
shore, a very short, plump person with a smiling
face. Though the face was unmistakably that
of a white girl, she was dressed from head to
toe in the fur garments of an Eskimo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there,&rdquo; she shouted, &ldquo;Let down the
gang plank. I want to come aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; laughed Florence. &ldquo;Wait
a minute. You climb out on that old tree.
We&rsquo;ll pole the yacht around beneath it, then
you can drop down on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a spiffy little cabin,&rdquo; exclaimed the
stranger as she entered the door and prepared
to draw her fur parka off over her head. &ldquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t expecting company. When did you arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came in with the ice-floe,&rdquo; smiled Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;are you a captive?&rdquo; asked Lucile
suddenly. &ldquo;And&mdash;and do they make you live
with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captive? Live with whom?&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s eyes
were big with wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Negontisks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Negontisks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, child. Of what are you dreaming?
I never saw a Negontisk, let alone living
with them. Heard of them though. Please
explain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>She bounced down into one of the overstuffed
chairs with a little sigh of &ldquo;Oh! What delicious
comfort! You don&rsquo;t know how strange
it is to live like an Eskimo. It&rsquo;s trying at times,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took a great deal of explaining for Lucile
to make the reasons for her questions clear to
the stranger. In the meantime, Florence had an
opportunity to study their visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very small, not weighing over ninety
pounds, very vivacious, decidedly American and
considerably older than we are,&rdquo; was her final
analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! My dear!&rdquo; the little lady cried when
Lucile had explained. &ldquo;You may put your
mind quite at ease. Besides yourselves I am
positively the only person on the island. What&rsquo;s
more,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;I have in my igloo oodles
and oodles of food, enough for all of us for
six months to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls fairly gasped in their relief
and delight. It was with the greatest difficulty
that they refrained from embracing the visitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;that you
would like to know how it comes about that I
am living here on this island all by myself; and,
above all things, in an igloo. Well, you see,
my uncle owns this island. He is a retired
Arctic trader. For twenty years he lived on
the coast of the Arctic&mdash;made a huge fortune
in furs and whale bone. Then he came back
to the city to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; she sighed after a pause
for breath, &ldquo;he had lived in igloos on the Arctic
coast for so long that he wasn&rsquo;t satisfied
with the cave he lived in on the shores, in the
noisy city. So what does he do but buy this
little island and have a wonderful little igloo
built beneath one of its sand dunes?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he doesn&rsquo;t live in his igloo all
the time; just comes over when he wishes to.
This winter he is spending in Florida so he lent
his igloo to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I graduated from the university last year.
And I wanted to write a book, a book about
the vanishing race&mdash;the Eskimo. Sort of
an Eskimo Ramona, don&rsquo;t you know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had never been in Alaska but my uncle
had told me about it. Nights and nights he
talked about nothing else, so I knew enough
to make a book. All I needed was the atmosphere.
I thought I could get that best by
coming out here and living in his igloo all by
myself, paddling about in a kiak, fishing through
the ice and all that. So that,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;is
how I came to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls stared at her with looks of
wonderment in which was mingled not a little
joy. Had she been a fairy come down from
some magic kingdom to render them a great
service she could hardly have been more welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, bouncing up from her
chair, &ldquo;You shall all go to my igloo. We will
have dinner together there and&mdash;and why don&rsquo;t
you bring along a few of your things, prepared
to stay all night? You&rsquo;ll hardly be leaving
to-night. No, of course you won&rsquo;t. Ice won&rsquo;t
let you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not alone the ice,&rdquo; said Florence soberly.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how to start our motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Those motors! There now!&rdquo; she exclaimed
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never told you my name. It&rsquo;s
Marie Neighbor. What are yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motors are a real bother,&rdquo; she said, returning
to her original subject. &ldquo;Uncle has had
six or eight of them in all, on cars, yachts and
all that. Not one of them was like any other
one. I puzzled my poor old head nearly off
over them but I always succeeded in making
them go. They&rsquo;re worse when there&rsquo;s no gas.
Once I tried a pint of ether and some moth
balls instead of gas. That came near being
my last experiment. The cylinder exploded.
Perhaps I can help you with your engine. Let&rsquo;s
have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence led the way to the engine room
and there switched on a light.</p>
<p>Marie studied the motor for a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But my dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed at last, &ldquo;this
wire should be fastened there and that one
here. You have them crossed. That will never
do. Hope you haven&rsquo;t ruined your batteries.
But never you mind, I have a set down at
the igloo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now about the timer. That screw&rsquo;s loose
there. Off time of course. Why, there&rsquo;s
nothing the matter with the motor; not really.
We&rsquo;ll have it going in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave the balance wheel a turn. There
followed a sucking sound. A second turn
brought a similar result; the third elicited a
loud explosion and the fourth threw the engine
into such a spasm of coughing as set the whole
yacht a-tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; she exclaimed triumphantly.
&ldquo;I told you there wasn&rsquo;t anything the
matter.&rdquo; She touched a lever. The engine
stopped. Then she reached for a handful of
waste with which to clean her dainty fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;shall we go over to the
igloo? I think the wind is changing. The ice
may be going out to-night. In that case you
may be wishing to leave in the morning. The
yacht will be all right here. No one about and
no chance for her to go out of the river. Throw
a line out and tie her to the shore. That&rsquo;ll make
her doubly safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delighted with this strange and efficient hostess,
the girls went about the task of making the
ship snug, then, having each gathered up a
small bundle of clothing, went ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Marie, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t
mind I think I&rsquo;d like to go back to the city
with you. I&rsquo;ll work my passage as chief engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be splendid!&rdquo; said Florence
enthusiastically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worrying about the
engine. We might get it going and not be able
to stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And might stop it and not get it going
again,&rdquo; laughed Marie. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s
arranged. A friend had promised to come after
me, but I was talking to him night before last
and he told me his boat had sprung a leak.
Didn&rsquo;t think he could come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking with him?&rdquo; cried Marian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, radio, don&rsquo;t you know. Oh! I didn&rsquo;t
tell you. I have a radiophone for short-distance
work. Uncle insisted on my having it; thought
I wouldn&rsquo;t be safe without it. When I wish
to talk to shore all I have to do is to hoist up
my two portable towers, key up my instrument
and start right in jabbering away. I have the
wireless too, and can talk to my uncle way
down in Florida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence took a long breath. &ldquo;So this,&rdquo; she
told herself, &ldquo;is the explanation of the phantom
wireless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Marie, &ldquo;your friends must
be anxious about you. Of course they must
be. I&rsquo;ll get my little talking machine going as
soon as we are at the igloo and you may tell
them all your troubles; also assure them you&rsquo;ll
be home to-morrow or the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! How can we thank you?&rdquo; cried Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; laughed their hostess. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t cost me anything and I&rsquo;m to get a free
passage home for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about things being free,&rdquo; she said
pointing to the splendid little evergreens all
about them. &ldquo;See all those trees! They really
should be thinned out. They&rsquo;re free for the
asking. Yet there are ten thousand homes in the
city where there will be no Christmas tree this
year. What do you say we cut down two or
three hundred of them and take them along?
We can play Santa to that many families anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a fine idea,&rdquo; said Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I! So do I,&rdquo; said the others in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then that&rsquo;s all settled. And now for
a lark. Watch out; here&rsquo;s the entrance to the
igloo. Just take a look down, then we&rsquo;ll get up
the towers and start talking across empty space
to the poor tired old city,&rdquo; laughed Marie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />AN UNEXPECTED WELCOME</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an exact reproduction of an igloo!&rdquo;
exclaimed Lucile.</p>
<p>The three girls, following the example of their
hostess, had dropped through a hole some three
feet square, had poised for an instant upon a
board landing, to drop a second three feet and
find themselves in a small square room. Leaving
this room, they had gone scooting along
a narrow passageway, to drop on their knees
and crawl through a circular opening into a
room some twenty feet square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed their hostess, &ldquo;have you
seen an igloo somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile smiled. &ldquo;Marian and I spent a year on
the Arctic coast of Alaska and Marian has
lived most of her life in Nome on Behring Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; Marie Neighbor&rsquo;s face was a
study, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;m just a&mdash;a&mdash;what do you
call it? a chechecko, I guess&mdash;beside you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, nothing like that,&rdquo; smiled Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway you&rsquo;ll help me with my book, won&rsquo;t
you? I have it only a third finished. After
dinner I&rsquo;ll read that to you and you may tell
me frankly whether it&rsquo;s any good or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried a story once myself,&rdquo; said Lucile
with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come out with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t come out yet, but I&rsquo;m really crazy
to get back to the city and find out about it.
I mailed it to the editor of &lsquo;Seaside Tales&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The igloo was heated by genuine seal-oil
lamps and over these Marie cooked her food.
The pots and kettles were of the antique copper
type traded to Eskimos by Russians long
before the white man reached the Arctic shore
of Alaska. The food cooked in this manner
over a slow fire was declared to be delicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said their hostess, when the
dishes had been washed and put away, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
introduce you to my alcove bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Drawing aside a pair of heavy deerskin curtains
she revealed a platform some six by eight
feet. This was piled high with skin rugs of
all descriptions. White bearskin, Russian squirrel,
red fox and beaver rivaled one another in
softness and richness of coloring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s sort of a compromise
between the narrow shelf of the Eskimo
igloo and the broader sleeping room of the
Chukches of Siberia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile and Marian were fascinated. It took
them back to the old days of Cape Prince of
Wales, of East Cape and Siberia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
all get fixed nice and comfy for going to sleep,
then we&rsquo;ll spread ourselves out in the midst of
all those wonderful rugs and you may read your
book to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;ll be asleep in ten minutes,&rdquo;
laughed Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! No we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; they all exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>A few moments later filmy pink and white
garments vied in color and softness with the
rugs of Arctic furs while Marie in a well modulated
tone read the beginning of the story of
Nowadluk, the belle of Alaska. The three companions
were quite content to listen. The ways
of life seemed once more very good to them.
Their friends had been notified by radiophone
of their safety. They were to return to-morrow
or the day after. The wind had changed.
The ice was already beginning to scatter.</p>
<p>Now and then Lucile or Marian would interrupt
the reader to make a suggestion. When
the end had been reached they were unanimous
in their assurance that it promised to be a wonderful
story. Their only regrets were that more
of it was not completed.</p>
<p>A half hour later Lucile and Marian were
asleep. Florence and Marie were talking in
whispers. Florence had been relating their
strange and weird experiences while living
aboard the O Moo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you thought I was held captive
by the Negontisks?&rdquo; Marie chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But really,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;there <i>were</i>
some of those people in Chicago. May be yet,
but no one knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; Florence breathed excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a great deal about it, only they
were brought over from Siberia for exhibition
purposes during a fair in Seattle. From there
they were brought to Chicago by a show company.
The company ran out of money and disbanded.
The Negontisks were thrown upon
their own resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were getting along one way or another
when it was discovered that they were worshipping
some kind of idol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blue face,&rdquo; whispered Florence breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that. It was believed that
in their religious rites they resorted to inhuman
practices. The government looked into the matter
and decided to deport them. But just when
the officials were preparing to round them up,
they found that the last one of them had vanished&mdash;vanished
as completely as they might
had the earth opened up and swallowed them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was two or three years ago. The
papers were full of it. I think there was a reward
offered for their capture. But I believe
they never found a trace of them or their blue
god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; whispered Florence, suddenly sitting
up among the robes. &ldquo;Oh, I do hope the ice is
gone by morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Aren&rsquo;t you happy here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I want to get back to the city&mdash;want
to awfully. You see, I think I know where
the blue god is and I want to go and find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the afternoon of the second day following
the night spent in the igloo before they
were able to leave the island. Ice still blocked
their path, that first day, so they had spent the
whole day piling the deck of the O Moo high
with Christmas trees. Since fate had been kind
to them in landing them on the hospitable shores
of this island they had been glad to do this much
toward the happiness of others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>The lake could never have appeared more
lovely. Its surface, smooth as a mirror, reflected
the white clouds which drifted lazily
overhead. The sun, sending its rosy reflections
over all, made each tiny wavelet seem a saddle
on the back of a fairy horse of dreamland.
Across this dreamland the O Moo cut her way.</p>
<p>Now they were nearing the city. For some
time they had been seeing the jagged line of sky
scrapers. Now they could catch the outline of
the beach by the dry dock. Toward this they
pointed the prow of the O Moo. A wireless
telephone message had made known to Dr.
Holmes the probable hour of their arrival. Old
Timmie would doubtless be prepared to get the
O Moo back upon her trestle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what makes the shore all around the
dock look so black?&rdquo; puzzled Lucile.</p>
<p>Just then there came a succession of faint and
distant pop-pop-pops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone coming to meet us,&rdquo; Lucile decided,
pleased at the thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Then there came another set of poppings,
another and another, all in slightly different
keys.</p>
<p>Now they could see the gasoline launches coming
toward them. Seeming but sea gulls for
size at first, they grew rapidly larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six of them,&rdquo; murmured Marian. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know we had that many friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their amazement grew as three other boats
put out from shore. Then Lucile, who had been
studying the beach exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe that black spot about the dry
dock moves. It seems to contract and expand,
to waver backward and forward. You don&rsquo;t
think it could be&mdash;be people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, of course&mdash;yes! I do believe it
is!&rdquo; cried Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the newspapers,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve published a lot of nonsense about our
silly adventure and all those people have come
down to see us come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the people in those motorboats are reporters,&rdquo;
groaned Marian. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last of our
life on the O Moo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s over anyway,&rdquo; said Lucile. Her face
was very sober. &ldquo;By the time we&rsquo;ve paid for
having this yacht put back in order, I figure
we&rsquo;ll have about enough money left to buy soup
and crackers for examination week and a ticket
home. Good-bye old university!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! Well,&rdquo; laughed Florence, &ldquo;no use
being gloomy about it. No use being gloomy
about anything. Life&rsquo;s too long for that. Let&rsquo;s
make up what we&rsquo;ll tell the reporters. They
won&rsquo;t print the truth anyway, so we might as
well tell them plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them what you like,&rdquo; said Marie Neighbor,
&ldquo;only please don&rsquo;t give them the location
of my island. I don&rsquo;t want them to come out
there bothering me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll guard your secret, never worry,&rdquo;
smiled Lucile.</p>
<p>When the reporters&rsquo; boats swarmed about
them, the girls told as little as they could, but
when later Dr. Holmes came on board with
three official reporters, they gave them the true
story of their adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>They were shown their own pictures on the
front pages of all the papers and were assured
that nothing but their adventure had been talked
of since their disappearance.</p>
<p>A woman had come on board with the reporters,
a trim, matronly woman in a tailored
suit. At her first opportunity she drew Florence
to one side to talk with her long and earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabin of the O Moo is a wreck,&rdquo; Marian
said to Dr. Holmes. &ldquo;But really, Mr. Holmes,
you may trust us to put it back into perfect
shape if it takes our last penny. You may send
upholsterers and decorators over as soon as the
O Moo is in dry dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut&mdash;tut!&rdquo; exclaimed the good doctor.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that trouble you. That&rsquo;s all provided
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Really you must let us pay for all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it ever occur to you,&rdquo; his eyes were
twinkling, &ldquo;that the O Moo might be insured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In&mdash;insured!&rdquo; Marian&rsquo;s knees gave way.
The news was too good to seem true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, then we can stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In school, yes, but on the O Moo, probably
not. Too much publicity, you see. University
people would object and all that, don&rsquo;t you know.
But then, cheer up. I fancy the lady dean is
telling Florence of something which will interest
you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;we are
not getting ashore. Yo-ho, Timmie,&rdquo; he cupped
his hands and shouted, &ldquo;bring on the rowboats
and tackle. Let&rsquo;s get her brought in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />HOT WATER AND A GHOST</h2>
<p>It was night. The crowd that had screamed
its welcome to the returning O Moo and her
crew was gone. A great truck loaded high with
Christmas trees had departed with Marie Neighbor
bouncing about on top of it.</p>
<p>The three girls were in the cabin of the O
Moo. This, they were sure, was to be their last
night on board. The lady dean had told Florence
that a flat belonging to the university, three
rooms, kitchenette and bath, was at their disposal.
The rent seemed terribly high to them,
but someway they must meet it, since the dean
had looked very sternly adown her nose and
said, &ldquo;Of course this sort of thing cannot be
gone on with. The university would be scandalized.
Besides, there is no telling what may
happen to you if you remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Lucile said with a long face as
the three of them discussed the matter, &ldquo;she
says it&rsquo;s a very nice apartment but it can&rsquo;t be
half as nice as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the O Moo,&rdquo; Florence put in. &ldquo;Of course
not. Nothing ever can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Marian sighed, &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll
have to do it. But I do think the old O Moo
is a dear. I shouldn&rsquo;t like anything better than
rambling through a whole summer with her
almost anywhere on the Great Lakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since this was to be their last night they
determined to make the most of it. They had
Mark Pence in for hot chocolate and vanilla
wafers. They told him of their adventures and
he spoke modestly of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he said, going back to the very
beginning of the story as he now knew it,
&ldquo;when these Negontisks found out they were
going to be deported they hunted out an unscrupulous
Chinaman who transformed them
into people of his own race. That wasn&rsquo;t hard.
They were Orientals anyway. All he had to do
was to provide them with black sateen suits and
artificial pigtails and the transformation was
complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Chinaman saw a chance to make a
lot of easy money. He put them to work in his
laundry&mdash;virtually made slaves of them. Fixed
up that old scow for them secretly and made
them sneak back and forth to work during the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lasted for a time, then the greedy old
Chinaman suddenly disappeared. Negontisks
sacrificed him to the blue god, like as not.
Served him right too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was where the police took up the
trail. The savages knew there was trouble
coming. They thought you were a plant&mdash;that
you were set here to spy on them. They&rsquo;d been
betrayed by some woman before, it seems.
When they couldn&rsquo;t get rid of you by frightening
you, they decided to cut you loose in a
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; began Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ve vanished. Not a trace of them
has been seen since that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a trace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence leaping to
her feet, &ldquo;I invite you all to a ghost hunt. A
ghost hunt for a blue god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything for a last nighter,&rdquo; agreed Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this type of ghost hunt,&rdquo; said Florence,
&ldquo;one needs an ax and two kettles of boiling
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll provide the ax,&rdquo; volunteered Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we the boiling water,&rdquo; chimed in
Marian and Lucile in unison.</p>
<p>It was a strange little procession that stole
from the shadow of the O Moo a short time
later. Florence led the way. She was profoundly
silent. Lucile and Marian followed,
each with a tea kettle of boiling water carefully
poised at her side. Mark, as a sort of vanguard,
brought up the rear with his ax. Now and then
Mark let forth a low chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Marian warned. &ldquo;You might disturb
her serious poise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Straight away toward the end of the lagoon
Florence led them. Once on the surface of the
lagoon her course was scarcely less certain until
she had reached a point in the center of the
broad, glistening surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should be right about here,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>Snapping on a flashlight she moved slowly
backward and forward, studying the ice beneath
the circle of intense light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold place for a ghost,&rdquo; whispered Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand people have skated over it
and cut it down. Can&rsquo;t tell. Maybe it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo;
Florence said under her breath, but still she kept
up the search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water&rsquo;s getting cooled off in the kettles.
Ghost won&rsquo;t mind it at all,&rdquo; whispered Mark.</p>
<p>Pausing on tiptoe for a moment, Florence
fixed her eyes on a certain spot. Then, bending
over, she brushed the ice clear of frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; she pointed, motioning to
Mark. &ldquo;Cut here. No&mdash;let me have the ax.
You might go too deep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>With measured and cautious swings she began
hacking a circle in the ice some two and a
half feet in circumference.</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s amusement had vanished. Curious
as the others, he bent over and watched in awed
silence. Eight inches of solid ice had been
chipped up and thrown out when they began
noticing its peculiar blueness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a frozen tub of blueing,&rdquo; whispered
Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; warned Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s have the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence took one of the teakettles and poured
the hot water into the hole she had cut.</p>
<p>As they stood there staring with all their
eyes, they thought they made out the outline of
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a dream picture on the movie screen,&rdquo;
whispered Marian.</p>
<p>Lucile pinched her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A face,&rdquo; came from Mark.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lucile gasped, wavered, and all but
sank down upon the ice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The face!&rdquo; she cried in a muffled scream.
&ldquo;The horrible blue face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it might be.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice
was tense with emotion.</p>
<p>She poured the second kettle of water into the
hole.</p>
<p>The pool of water was blue, but through it
there appeared the dim outlines of an unspeakably
ugly face.</p>
<p>With trembling fingers Florence tested the
water. Twice she found it too hot. The third
time she plunged in her hand. There followed
a sound of water being sucked up by some
object. The next instant she placed on the ice,
within the circle of light, a strange affair of
blue stone.</p>
<p>Covering her eyes Lucile sprang back shuddering.
&ldquo;The blue face! The terrible blue
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marian and Mark stared curiously.</p>
<p>Florence straightened up. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said
with an air of great satisfaction, &ldquo;is the marvelous
and much-sought blue god.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; came from Marian and Mark.
Lucile uncovered her eyes to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly harmless; merely a blue jade carving.
Nevertheless a thing of some importance,
unless I miss my guess,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;I
suggest that we take it to the police station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; exclaimed Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Right now!&rdquo; demanded Lucile
through chattering teeth. &ldquo;I could never sleep
with that thing on board the O Moo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at police headquarters, they asked
for their friend, the sergeant. When he came
out, his eyes appeared heavy with sleep, but once
they fell upon the thing of blue jade it seemed
that they would pop out of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is! No, it
can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking it in his hands he turned it over and
over, muttering to himself. Then, &ldquo;Wait a
minute,&rdquo; he said. Handing the blue face to
Florence, he dashed to the telephone.</p>
<p>There for a moment he quarreled with an
operator, then talked to someone for an instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said as he returned, &ldquo;was your
friend, Mr. Cole, from down in the new
museum. He lives near here. He&rsquo;s coming
over. He&rsquo;ll tell us for sure. He knows everything.
Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For ten minutes nothing was heard in the
room save the tick-tock of a prodigious clock
hung against the wall. From Florence&rsquo;s lap the
blue god leered defiance to the world.</p>
<p>Suddenly a man without hat or collar dashed
into the room. It was Cole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; he demanded breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Florence held out the blue face.</p>
<p>For a full five minutes the great curator
studied the face in silence. Turning it over and
over, he now and again uttered a little cry of
delight.</p>
<p>Florence, as she watched him, thought he
could not have been more pleased had a long-lost
son been returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; he murmured at last. &ldquo;It is the blue
god of the Negontisks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See that!&rdquo; exclaimed the sergeant, springing
to his feet. &ldquo;I told you he&rsquo;d know. And
that&rsquo;s the end of that business. The whole gang
of &rsquo;em was caught in Sioux City, Iowa, last
night, but they didn&rsquo;t have the blue god. They&rsquo;ll
be deported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will&mdash;will you give it back to them now?&rdquo;
faltered Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it back?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say not!
You don&rsquo;t know what crimes have been committed
in the name of the blue god. No! No!
We&rsquo;ll not give it back. If they must have one
when they get to where they&rsquo;re going they&rsquo;ll
have to find a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; said Cole, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to speak with
you, privately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two adjourned to a corner, where for
some time they conversed earnestly. The sergeant
might be seen to shake his head emphatically
from time to time.</p>
<p>At last they returned to the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have been trying,&rdquo; said Cole thoughtfully,
&ldquo;to persuade the sergeant to allow you to sell
the blue god to our museum. It is worth considerable
money merely as a specimen, but he
won&rsquo;t hear to it; says it&rsquo;s sort of contraband
and must be held by the police. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m
sure you could have used the money to good
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right&mdash;&rdquo; The words stuck
in Florence&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on now! Hold on!&rdquo; exclaimed the
sergeant, growing very red in the face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not so hard-hearted as I might seem. There&rsquo;s
a reward of five hundred dollars offered for the
arrest and conviction&mdash;or words to that effect&mdash;of
this here blue god. Now you girls have
arrested him and before Mr. Cole he&rsquo;s been
convicted. All&rsquo;s left is to make out the claims
and I&rsquo;ll do that free gratis and for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hun&mdash;five hundred dollars!&rdquo; the girls
exclaimed.</p>
<p>The sergeant stepped back a pace. It was
evident that he was in fear of the embarrassment
which might come to him by being embraced
by three young ladies in a police station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll lock him up for the night,&rdquo; he muttered
huskily and promptly disappeared into a
vault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that&rsquo;s all of that,&rdquo; breathed
Florence. &ldquo;Quite a thrilling night for our last
on the O Moo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite all,&rdquo; said Cole. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still the
blue candlestick. The state makes no claims
upon that. In the name of the museum I offer
you two hundred dollars for it. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid! Wonderful!&rdquo; came from the
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Come round in the morning for
the check. Good-night.&rdquo; He disappeared into
the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re rich,&rdquo; sighed Lucile as they
walked toward the O Moo, &ldquo;but you know I
have a private fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew a letter from her pocket and waved
it in air. &ldquo;One hundred dollars for my story.
Hooray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; came from the rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; sighed Lucile, &ldquo;the editor said
the check would spoil me for life, but since the
story was worth it he was bound to buy it.
Regular fatherly letter, but he&rsquo;s a dear and the
check is real money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To eat has a more pleasant sound than to
sleep,&rdquo; said Florence when they were once more
in the cabin of the O Moo. &ldquo;What do you say
to lamb chops, french fried potatoes, hot coffee
and doughnuts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At two in the morning?&rdquo; grinned Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a better time? All in favor, say
&lsquo;aye.&rsquo; The ayes have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a few things I don&rsquo;t yet understand,&rdquo;
said Lucile as they sat enjoying their
repast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lot that I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added Mark. &ldquo;Miss
Florence Huyler, the pleasure&rsquo;s all yours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;it was about like
this: The Negontisks were living in that old
scow. Instead of three or four sleepy old
Chinamen, there were twenty or thirty near-savages
skulking about this dry dock. Being
afraid of us, they tacked a note of warning to
our yacht. When we didn&rsquo;t leave they decided
to frighten us or kill us, I don&rsquo;t know which.
They chased me into the old museum and tried
to surround Lucile among the ice-piles. Lucile&rsquo;s
seeing the blue face in the old Mission was of
course an accident; so too was my finding the
blue candlestick. That man who chased me lost
it. When other plans failed they decided to set
us adrift, which they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the blue god frozen in the ice?&rdquo; questioned
Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the two men with the sled
and the one man who appeared to come from
nowhere? Well, I guess he was dropped off the
sled with the blue god, a jug of blue water, and
an ax. He cut a hole in the ice and, after covering
the blue god with blue water left it to be
frozen in. I stumbled upon the spot next morning.
Little by little I guessed what was hidden
there and how it was hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems strange they never came back for it,&rdquo;
said Lucile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Police were too hot on their tracks,&rdquo; declared
Mark. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t dare to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;is the story of
the blue god. Quite an exciting episode. To-morrow
we enter upon the monotonous life of
modern city cave dwellers. Good-bye to romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mark, &ldquo;you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose. &ldquo;I must bid you good-night and
good-bye. I work in the &lsquo;stacks&rsquo; of your great
university library. Come to see me there sometime.
Perhaps I might dish up a bit of excitement
for you, you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed himself out of the cabin. Fifteen
minutes later the cabin was dark. The cruise of
the O Moo was at an end.</p>
